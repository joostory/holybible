him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows, turned back on the day of battle;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">they did not keep God&#x27;s covenant and refused to live by his law.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter

But can he also give us food?

Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">How often they rebelled against him in the desert and grieved him in the wasteland!</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Again and again they put God to the test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">They did not remember his power-- the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">the day he displayed his miraculous signs in Egypt, his wonders in the region of Zoan.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He turned their rivers to blood; they could not drink from their streams.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He gave their crops to the grasshopper, their produce to the locust.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He gave over their cattle to the hail, their livestock to bolts of lightning.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He unleashed against them his hot anger, his wrath, indignation and hostility-- a band of destroying angels.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He prepared a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But he brought his people out like a flock; he led them like sheep through the desert.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He guided them safely, so they were unafraid; but the sea engulfed their enemies.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Thus he brought them to the border of his holy land, to the hill country his right hand had taken.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He drove out nations before them and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance; he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High; they did not keep his statutes.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Like their fathers they were disloyal and faithless, as unreliable as a faulty bow.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When God heard them, he was very angry; he rejected Israel completely.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent he had set up among men.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He sent the ark of his might into captivity, his splendor into the hands of the enemy.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He gave his people over to the sword; he was very angry with his inheritance.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Fire consumed their young men, and their maidens had no wedding songs;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">their priests were put to the sword, and their widows could not weep.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, as a man wakes from the stupor of wine.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He beat back his enemies; he put them to everlasting shame.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then he rejected the tents of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">from tending the sheep he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel his inheritance.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And David shepherded them with integrity of heart; with skillful hands he led them.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto
