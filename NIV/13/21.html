My lord the king, are they not all my lord&#x27;s subjects? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?&quot;</li><li>The king&#x27;s word, however, overruled Joab; so Joab left and went throughout Israel and then came back to Jerusalem.</li><li>Joab reported the number of the fighting men to David: In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who could handle a sword, including four hundred and seventy thousand in Judah.</li><li>But Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, because the king&#x27;s command was repulsive to him.</li><li>This command was also evil in the sight of God; so he punished Israel.</li><li>Then David said to God, &quot;I have sinned greatly by doing this.

But as the angel was doing so, the LORD saw it and was grieved because of the calamity and said to the angel who was destroying the people, &quot;Enough! Withdraw your hand.&quot; The angel of the LORD was then standing at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</li><li>David looked up and saw the angel of the LORD standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand extended over Jerusalem.

These are but sheep. What have they done? O LORD my God, let your hand fall upon me and my family, but do not let this plague remain on your people.&quot;</li><li>Then the angel of the LORD ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</li><li>So David went up in obedience to the word that Gad had spoken in the name of the LORD.</li><li>While Araunah was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the angel; his four sons who were with him hid themselves.</li><li>Then David approached, and when Araunah looked and saw him, he left the threshing floor and bowed down before David with his face to the ground.</li><li>David said to him, &quot;Let me have the site of your threshing floor so I can build an altar to the LORD, that the plague on the people may be stopped.
