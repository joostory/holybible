She and her family went away and stayed in the land of the Philistines seven years.</li><li>At the end of the seven years she came back from the land of the Philistines and went to the king to beg for her house and land.</li><li>The king was talking to Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, and had said, &quot;Tell me about all the great things Elisha has done.&quot;</li><li>Just as Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had restored the dead to life, the woman whose son Elisha had brought back to life came to beg the king for her house and land. Gehazi said, &quot;This is the woman, my lord the king, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life.&quot;</li><li>The king asked the woman about it, and she told him. Then he assigned an official to her case and said to him, &quot;Give back everything that belonged to her, including all the income from her land from the day she left the country until now.&quot;</li><li>Elisha went to Damascus, and Ben-Hadad king of Aram was ill. When the king was told, &quot;The man of God has come all the way up here,&quot;</li><li>he said to Hazael, &quot;Take a gift with you and go to meet the man of God. Consult the LORD through him; ask him, &#x27;Will I recover from this illness?&#x27; &quot;</li><li>Hazael went to meet Elisha, taking with him as a gift forty camel-loads of all the finest wares of Damascus.

Then the man of God began to weep.</li><li>&quot;Why is my lord weeping?&quot; asked Hazael. &quot;Because I know the harm you will do to the Israelites,&quot; he answered. &quot;You will set fire to their fortified places, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little children to the ground, and rip open their pregnant women.&quot;</li><li>Hazael said, &quot;How could your servant, a mere dog, accomplish such a feat?&quot; &quot;The LORD has shown me that you will become king of Aram,&quot; answered Elisha.</li><li>Then Hazael left Elisha and returned to his master. When Ben-Hadad asked, &quot;What did Elisha say to you?&quot; Hazael replied, &quot;He told me that you would certainly recover.&quot;</li><li>But the next day he took a thick cloth, soaked it in water and spread it over the king&#x27;s face, so that he died.

The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he rose up and broke through by night; his army, however, fled back home.</li><li>To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah. Libnah revolted at the same time.</li><li>As for the other events of Jehoram&#x27;s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?</li><li>Jehoram rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David.
