Elisha summoned a man from the company of the prophets and said to him, &quot;Tuck your cloak into your belt, take this flask of oil with you and go to Ramoth Gilead.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When you get there, look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go to him, get him away from his companions and take him into an inner room.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then take the flask and pour the oil on his head and declare, &#x27;This is what the LORD says: I anoint you king over Israel.&#x27; Then open the door and run; don&#x27;t delay!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So the young man, the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he arrived, he found the army officers sitting together. &quot;I have a message for you, commander,&quot; he said. &quot;For which of us?&quot; asked Jehu. &quot;For you, commander,&quot; he replied.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jehu got up and went into the house. Then the prophet poured the oil on Jehu&#x27;s head and declared, &quot;This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: &#x27;I anoint you king over the LORD&#x27;s people Israel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You are to destroy the house of Ahab your master, and I will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the LORD&#x27;s servants shed by Jezebel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The whole house of Ahab will perish. I will cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel--slave or free.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As for Jezebel, dogs will devour her on the plot of ground at Jezreel, and no one will bury her.&#x27; &quot; Then he opened the door and ran.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Jehu went out to his fellow officers, one of them asked him, &quot;Is everything all right? Why did this madman come to you?&quot; &quot;You know the man and the sort of things he says,&quot; Jehu replied.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;That&#x27;s not true!&quot; they said. &quot;Tell us.&quot; Jehu said, &quot;Here is what he told me: &#x27;This is what the LORD says: I anoint you king over Israel.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They hurried and took their cloaks and spread them under him on the bare steps. Then they blew the trumpet and shouted, &quot;Jehu is king!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth Gilead against Hazael king of Aram,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">but King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him in the battle with Hazael king of Aram.) Jehu said, &quot;If this is the way you feel, don&#x27;t let anyone slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he got into his chariot and rode to Jezreel, because Joram was resting there and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the lookout standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu&#x27;s troops approaching, he called out, &quot;I see some troops coming.&quot; &quot;Get a horseman,&quot; Joram ordered. &quot;Send him to meet them and ask, &#x27;Do you come in peace?&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The horseman rode off to meet Jehu and said, &quot;This is what the king says: &#x27;Do you come in peace?&#x27; &quot; &quot;What do you have to do with peace?&quot; Jehu replied. &quot;Fall in behind me.&quot; The lookout reported, &quot;The messenger has reached them, but he isn&#x27;t coming back.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So the king sent out a second horseman. When he came to them he said, &quot;This is what the king says: &#x27;Do you come in peace?&#x27; &quot; Jehu replied, &quot;What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The lookout reported, &quot;He has reached them, but he isn&#x27;t coming back either. The driving is like that of Jehu son of Nimshi--he drives like a madman.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Hitch up my chariot,&quot; Joram ordered. And when it was hitched up, Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah rode out, each in his own chariot, to meet Jehu. They met him at the plot of ground that had belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Joram saw Jehu he asked, &quot;Have you come in peace, Jehu?&quot; &quot;How can there be peace,&quot; Jehu replied, &quot;as long as all the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Joram turned about and fled, calling out to Ahaziah, &quot;Treachery, Ahaziah!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart and he slumped down in his chariot.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jehu said to Bidkar, his chariot officer, &quot;Pick him up and throw him on the field that belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember how you and I were riding together in chariots behind Ahab his father when the LORD made this prophecy about him:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&#x27;Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, declares the LORD, and I will surely make you pay for it on this plot of ground, declares the LORD.&#x27; Now then, pick him up and throw him on that plot, in accordance with the word of the LORD.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Ahaziah king of Judah saw what had happened, he fled up the road to Beth Haggan. Jehu chased him, shouting, &quot;Kill him too!&quot; They wounded him in his chariot on the way up to Gur near Ibleam, but he escaped to Megiddo and died there.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">His servants took him by chariot to Jerusalem and buried him with his fathers in his tomb in the City of David.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">(In the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king of Judah.)</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Jehu went to Jezreel. When Jezebel heard about it, she painted her eyes, arranged her hair and looked out of a window.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As Jehu entered the gate, she asked, &quot;Have you come in peace, Zimri, you murderer of your master?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He looked up at the window and called out, &quot;Who is on my side? Who?&quot; Two or three eunuchs looked down at him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Throw her down!&quot; Jehu said. So they threw her down, and some of her blood spattered the wall and the horses as they trampled her underfoot.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jehu went in and ate and drank. &quot;Take care of that cursed woman,&quot; he said, &quot;and bury her, for she was a king&#x27;s daughter.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But when they went out to bury her, they found nothing except her skull, her feet and her hands.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They went back and told Jehu, who said, &quot;This is the word of the LORD that he spoke through his servant Elijah the Tishbite: On the plot of ground at Jezreel dogs will devour Jezebel&#x27;s flesh.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jezebel&#x27;s body will be like refuse on the ground in the plot at Jezreel, so that no one will be able to say,
