Jehu said, &quot;If this is the way you feel, don&#x27;t let anyone slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel.&quot;</li><li>Then he got into his chariot and rode to Jezreel, because Joram was resting there and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him.</li><li>When the lookout standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu&#x27;s troops approaching, he called out, &quot;I see some troops coming.&quot; &quot;Get a horseman,&quot; Joram ordered. &quot;Send him to meet them and ask, &#x27;Do you come in peace?&#x27; &quot;</li><li>The horseman rode off to meet Jehu and said, &quot;This is what the king says: &#x27;Do you come in peace?&#x27; &quot; &quot;What do you have to do with peace?&quot; Jehu replied. &quot;Fall in behind me.&quot; The lookout reported, &quot;The messenger has reached them, but he isn&#x27;t coming back.&quot;</li><li>So the king sent out a second horseman.
