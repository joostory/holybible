From the threshing floor? From the winepress?&quot;</li><li>Then he asked her, &quot;What&#x27;s the matter?&quot; She answered, &quot;This woman said to me, &#x27;Give up your son so we may eat him today, and tomorrow we&#x27;ll eat my son.&#x27;</li><li>So we cooked my son and ate him. The next day I said to her, &#x27;Give up your son so we may eat him,&#x27; but she had hidden him.&quot;</li><li>When the king heard the woman&#x27;s words, he tore his robes.
