There&#x27;s the Shunammite!</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Run to meet her and ask her, &#x27;Are you all right? Is your husband all right?

Gehazi came over to push her away, but the man of God said, &quot;Leave her alone! She is in bitter distress, but the LORD has hidden it from me and has not told me why.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;Did I ask you for a son, my lord?&quot; she said. &quot;Didn&#x27;t I tell you, &#x27;Don&#x27;t raise my hopes&#x27;?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Elisha said to Gehazi, &quot;Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand and run.

So Gehazi went back to meet Elisha and told him, &quot;The boy has not awakened.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When Elisha reached the house, there was the boy lying dead on his couch.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He went in, shut the door on the two of them and prayed to the LORD.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then he got on the bed and lay upon the boy, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands. As he stretched himself out upon him, the boy&#x27;s body grew warm.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Elisha turned away and walked back and forth in the room and then got on the bed and stretched out upon him once more. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, &quot;Call the Shunammite.&quot; And he did. When she came, he said, &quot;Take your son.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">She came in, fell at his feet and bowed to the ground. Then she took her son and went out.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Elisha returned to Gilgal and there was a famine in that region. While the company of the prophets was meeting with him, he said to his servant, &quot;Put on the large pot and cook some stew for these men.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">One of them went out into the fields to gather herbs and found a wild vine. He gathered some of its gourds and filled the fold of his cloak. When he returned, he cut them up into the pot of stew, though no one knew what they were.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The stew was poured out for the men, but as they began to eat it, they cried out, &quot;O man of God, there is death in the pot!&quot; And they could not eat it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Elisha said, &quot;Get some flour.&quot; He put it into the pot and said, &quot;Serve it to the people to eat.&quot; And there was nothing harmful in the pot.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">A man came from Baal Shalishah, bringing the man of God twenty loaves of barley bread baked from the first ripe grain, along with some heads of new grain. &quot;Give it to the people to eat,&quot; Elisha said.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;How can I set this before a hundred men?&quot; his servant asked. But Elisha answered, &quot;Give it to the people to eat. For this is what the LORD says: &#x27;They will eat and have some left over.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of the LORD.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4 text-base gap-y-2 w-full"><li class="__className_872c54"><a href="/NIV"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-5 w-5"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.75 19.5 8.25 12l7.5-7.5"></path></svg></a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/1">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/2">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->2</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/3">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->3</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="menu-active" href="/NIV/12/4">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->4</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/5">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->5</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/6">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->6</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/7">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->7</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/8">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->8</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/9">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->9</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/10">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->10</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/11">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->11</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/12">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->12</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/13">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->13</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/14">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->14</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/15">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->15</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/16">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->16</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/17">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->17</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/18">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->18</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/19">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->19</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/20">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->20</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/21">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->21</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/22">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->22</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/23">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->23</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/24">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->24</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/25">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->25</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"version":{"name":"NIV","vcode":"NIV"},"bible":{"bcode":12,"chapterCount":25,"name":"2 Kings","type":"old","vcode":"NIV"},"chapter":"4","verses":[{"bcode":12,"cnum":4,"content":"The wife of a man from the company of the prophets cried out to Elisha, \"Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that he revered the LORD.
