You and your sons can live on what is left.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">One day Elisha went to Shunem. And a well-to-do woman was there, who urged him to stay for a meal. So whenever he came by, he stopped there to eat.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">She said to her husband, &quot;I know that this man who often comes our way is a holy man of God.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Let&#x27;s make a small room on the roof and put in it a bed and a table, a chair and a lamp for him.

Is your child all right?&#x27; &quot; &quot;Everything is all right,&quot; she said.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">When she reached the man of God at the mountain, she took hold of his feet. Gehazi came over to push her away, but the man of God said, &quot;Leave her alone! She is in bitter distress, but the LORD has hidden it from me and has not told me why.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;Did I ask you for a son, my lord?&quot; she said. &quot;Didn&#x27;t I tell you, &#x27;Don&#x27;t raise my hopes&#x27;?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Elisha said to Gehazi, &quot;Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand and run. If you meet anyone, do not greet him, and if anyone greets you, do not answer. Lay my staff on the boy&#x27;s face.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">But the child&#x27;s mother said, &quot;As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you.&quot; So he got up and followed her.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the boy&#x27;s face, but there was no sound or response. So Gehazi went back to meet Elisha and told him, &quot;The boy has not awakened.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">When Elisha reached the house, there was the boy lying dead on his couch.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">He went in, shut the door on the two of them and prayed to the LORD.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then he got on the bed and lay upon the boy, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands. As he stretched himself out upon him, the boy&#x27;s body grew warm.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Elisha turned away and walked back and forth in the room and then got on the bed and stretched out upon him once more. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, &quot;Call the Shunammite.&quot; And he did. When she came, he said, &quot;Take your son.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">She came in, fell at his feet and bowed to the ground. Then she took her son and went out.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Elisha returned to Gilgal and there was a famine in that region. While the company of the prophets was meeting with him, he said to his servant, &quot;Put on the large pot and cook some stew for these men.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">One of them went out into the fields to gather herbs and found a wild vine. He gathered some of its gourds and filled the fold of his cloak. When he returned, he cut them up into the pot of stew, though no one knew what they were.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The stew was poured out for the men, but as they began to eat it, they cried out, &quot;O man of God, there is death in the pot!&quot; And they could not eat it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Elisha said, &quot;Get some flour.&quot; He put it into the pot and said, &quot;Serve it to the people to eat.&quot; And there was nothing harmful in the pot.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">A man came from Baal Shalishah, bringing the man of God twenty loaves of barley bread baked from the first ripe grain, along with some heads of new grain. &quot;Give it to the people to eat,&quot; Elisha said.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;How can I set this before a hundred men?&quot; his servant asked. But Elisha answered, &quot;Give it to the people to eat. For this is what the LORD says: &#x27;They will eat and have some left over.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of the LORD.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4"><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a href="/NIV"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" class="h-5 w-5"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.75 19.5L8.25 12l7.5-7.5"></path></svg></a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/1">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/2">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->2</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/3">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->3</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="active" href="/NIV/12/4">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->4</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/5">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->5</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/6">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->6</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/7">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->7</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/8">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->8</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/9">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->9</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/10">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->10</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/11">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->11</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/12">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->12</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/13">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->13</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/14">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->14</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/15">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->15</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/16">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->16</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/17">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->17</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/18">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->18</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/19">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->19</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/20">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->20</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/21">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->21</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/22">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->22</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/23">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->23</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/24">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->24</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/12/25">2 Kings<!-- --> <!-- -->25</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"version":{"name":"NIV","vcode":"NIV"},"bible":{"bcode":12,"chapterCount":25,"name":"2 Kings","type":"old","vcode":"NIV"},"chapter":"4","verses":[{"bcode":12,"cnum":4,"content":"The wife of a man from the company of the prophets cried out to Elisha, \"Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that he revered the LORD.
