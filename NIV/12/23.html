people of Jerusalem, the priests and the prophets--all the people from the least to the greatest. He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant, which had been found in the temple of the LORD.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The king stood by the pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the LORD -to follow the LORD and keep his commands, regulations and decrees with all his heart and all his soul, thus confirming the words of the covenant written in this book. Then all the people pledged themselves to the covenant.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The king ordered Hilkiah the high priest, the priests next in rank and the doorkeepers to remove from the temple of the LORD all the articles made for Baal and Asherah and all the starry hosts. He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron Valley and took the ashes to Bethel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He did away with the pagan priests appointed by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high places of the towns of Judah and on those around Jerusalem--those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and moon, to the constellations and to all the starry hosts.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He took the Asherah pole from the temple of the LORD to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem and burned it there. He ground it to powder and scattered the dust over the graves of the common people.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He also tore down the quarters of the male shrine prostitutes, which were in the temple of the LORD and where women did weaving for Asherah.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Josiah brought all the priests from the towns of Judah and desecrated the high places, from Geba to Beersheba, where the priests had burned incense. He broke down the shrines at the gates--at the entrance to the Gate of Joshua, the city governor, which is on the left of the city gate.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Although the priests of the high places did not serve at the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, they ate unleavened bread with their fellow priests.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He desecrated Topheth, which was in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, so no one could use it to sacrifice his son or daughter in the fire to Molech.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He removed from the entrance to the temple of the LORD the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun. They were in the court near the room of an official named Nathan-Melech. Josiah then burned the chariots dedicated to the sun.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He pulled down the altars the kings of Judah had erected on the roof near the upper room of Ahaz, and the altars Manasseh had built in the two courts of the temple of the LORD. He removed them from there, smashed them to pieces and threw the rubble into the Kidron Valley.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The king also desecrated the high places that were east of Jerusalem on the south of the Hill of Corruption--the ones Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the vile goddess of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the vile god of Moab, and for Molech the detestable god of the people of Ammon.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Josiah smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles and covered the sites with human bones.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Even the altar at Bethel, the high place made by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin--even that altar and high place he demolished. He burned the high place and ground it to powder, and burned the Asherah pole also.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Josiah looked around, and when he saw the tombs that were there on the hillside, he had the bones removed from them and burned on the altar to defile it, in accordance with the word of the LORD proclaimed by the man of God who foretold these things.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The king asked, &quot;What is that tombstone I see?&quot; The men of the city said, &quot;It marks the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and pronounced against the altar of Bethel the very things you have done to it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Leave it alone,&quot; he said. &quot;Don&#x27;t let anyone disturb his bones.&quot; So they spared his bones and those of the prophet who had come from Samaria.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Just as he had done at Bethel, Josiah removed and defiled all the shrines at the high places that the kings of Israel had built in the towns of Samaria that had provoked the LORD to anger.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Josiah slaughtered all the priests of those high places on the altars and burned human bones on them. Then he went back to Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The king gave this order to all the people: &quot;Celebrate the Passover to the LORD your God, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Not since the days of the judges who led Israel, nor throughout the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah, had any such Passover been observed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was celebrated to the LORD in Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Furthermore, Josiah got rid of the mediums and spiritists, the household gods, the idols and all the other detestable things seen in Judah and Jerusalem. This he did to fulfill the requirements of the law written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had discovered in the temple of the LORD.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Neither before nor after Josiah was there a king like him who turned to the LORD as he did--with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength, in accordance with all the Law of Moses.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Nevertheless, the LORD did not turn away from the heat of his fierce anger, which burned against Judah because of all that Manasseh had done to provoke him to anger.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So the LORD said, &quot;I will remove Judah also from my presence as I removed Israel, and I will reject Jerusalem, the city I chose, and this temple, about which I said, &#x27;There shall my Name be.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As for the other events of Josiah&#x27;s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">While Josiah was king, Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt went up to the Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria. King Josiah marched out to meet him in battle, but Neco faced him and killed him at Megiddo.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Josiah&#x27;s servants brought his body in a chariot from Megiddo to Jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and anointed him and made him king in place of his father.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother&#x27;s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just as his fathers had done.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Pharaoh Neco put him in chains at Riblah in the land of Hamath so that he might not reign in Jerusalem, and he imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah and changed Eliakim&#x27;s name to Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz and carried him off to Egypt, and there he died.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jehoiakim paid Pharaoh Neco the silver and gold he demanded. In order to do so, he taxed the land and exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land according to their assessments.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother&#x27;s name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah; she was from Rumah.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And he did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just
