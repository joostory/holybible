by year. Therefore Shalmaneser seized him and put him in prison.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The king of Assyria invaded the entire land, marched against Samaria and laid siege to it for three years.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the Israelites to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River and in the towns of the Medes.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">All this took place because the Israelites had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up out of Egypt from under the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

They practiced divination and sorcery and sold themselves to do evil in the eyes of the LORD, provoking him to anger.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So the LORD was very angry with Israel and removed them from his presence.

They neither worship the LORD nor adhere to the decrees and ordinances, the laws and commands that the LORD gave the descendants of Jacob, whom he named Israel.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When the LORD made a covenant with the Israelites, he commanded them: &quot;Do not worship any other gods or bow down to them, serve them or sacrifice to them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But the LORD, who brought you up out of Egypt with mighty power and outstretched arm, is the one you must worship. To him you shall bow down and to him offer sacrifices.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">You must always be careful to keep the decrees and ordinances, the laws and commands he wrote for you. Do not worship other gods.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Do not forget the covenant I have made with you, and do not worship other gods.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Rather, worship the LORD your God; it is he who will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">They would not listen, however, but persisted in their former practices.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Even while these people were worshiping the LORD, they were serving their idols.
