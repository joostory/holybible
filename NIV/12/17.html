tribute.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">But the king of Assyria discovered that Hoshea was a traitor, for he had sent envoys to So king of Egypt, and he no longer paid tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. Therefore Shalmaneser seized him and put him in prison.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">The king of Assyria invaded the entire land, marched against Samaria and laid siege to it for three years.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the Israelites to Assyria.

They worshiped other gods</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">and followed the practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before them, as well as the practices that the kings of Israel had introduced.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">The Israelites secretly did things against the LORD their God that were not right. From watchtower to fortified city they built themselves high places in all their towns.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">They set up sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">At every high place they burned incense, as the nations whom the LORD had driven out before them had done.

They followed worthless idols and themselves became worthless. They imitated the nations around them although the LORD had ordered them, &quot;Do not do as they do,&quot; and they did the things the LORD had forbidden them to do.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">They forsook all the commands of the LORD their God and made for themselves two idols cast in the shape of calves, and an Asherah pole.
