They said to each other, &quot;Why stay here until we die?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If we say, &#x27;We&#x27;ll go into the city&#x27;-the famine is there, and we will die. And if we stay here, we will die. So let&#x27;s go over to the camp of the Arameans and surrender. If they spare us, we live; if they kill us, then we die.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At dusk they got up and went to the camp of the Arameans. When they reached the edge of the camp, not a man was there,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">for the Lord had caused the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots and horses and a great army, so that they said to one another, &quot;Look, the king of Israel has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to attack us!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So they got up and fled in the dusk and abandoned their tents and their horses and donkeys. They left the camp as it was and ran for their lives.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The men who had leprosy reached the edge of the camp and entered one of the tents. They ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold and clothes, and went off and hid them.

Let&#x27;s go at once and report this to the royal palace.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So they went and called out to the city gatekeepers and told them, &quot;We went into the Aramean camp and not a man was there--not a sound of anyone--only tethered horses and donkeys, and the tents left just as they were.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The gatekeepers shouted the news, and it was reported within the palace.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The king got up in the night and said to his officers, &quot;I will tell you what the Arameans have done to us.

Their plight will be like that of all the Israelites left here--yes, they will only be like all these Israelites who are doomed. So let us send them to find out what happened.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So they selected two chariots with their horses, and the king sent them after the Aramean army. He commanded the drivers, &quot;Go and find out what has happened.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They followed them as far as the Jordan, and they found the whole road strewn with the clothing and equipment the Arameans had thrown away in their headlong flight. So the messengers returned and reported to the king.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. So a seah of flour sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley sold for a shekel, as the LORD had said.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now the king had put the officer on whose arm he leaned in charge of the gate, and the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died, just as the man of God had foretold when the king came down to his house.</li><li
