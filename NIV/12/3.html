He got rid of the sacred stone of Baal that his father had made.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Nevertheless he clung to the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit; he did not turn away from them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now Mesha king of Moab raised sheep, and he had to supply the king of Israel with a hundred thousand lambs and with the wool of a hundred thousand rams.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But after Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So at that time King Joram set out from Samaria and mobilized all Israel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He also sent this message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah: &quot;The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?&quot; &quot;I will go with you,&quot; he replied. &quot;I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;By what route shall we attack?&quot; he asked. &quot;Through the Desert of Edom,&quot; he answered.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So the king of Israel set out with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. After a roundabout march of seven days, the army had no more water for themselves or for the animals with them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;What!&quot; exclaimed the king of Israel. &quot;Has the LORD called us three kings together only to hand us over to Moab?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Jehoshaphat asked, &quot;Is there no prophet of the LORD here, that we may inquire of the LORD through him?&quot; An officer of the king of Israel answered, &quot;Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to pour water on the hands of Elijah. &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jehoshaphat said, &quot;The word of the LORD is with him.&quot; So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Elisha said to the king of Israel, &quot;What do we have to do with each other?

Now to the plunder, Moab!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But when the Moabites came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and fought them until they fled. And the Israelites invaded the land and slaughtered the Moabites.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They destroyed the towns, and each man threw a stone on every good field until it was covered. They stopped up all the springs and cut down every good tree. Only Kir Hareseth was left with its stones in place, but men armed with slings surrounded it and attacked it as well.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the king of Moab saw that the battle had gone against him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom, but they failed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him as a sacrifice on the city wall.
