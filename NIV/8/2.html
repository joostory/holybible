Don&#x27;t go and glean in another field and don&#x27;t go away from here. Stay here with my servant girls.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the girls.

She ate all she wanted and had some left over.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men, &quot;Even if she gathers among the sheaves, don&#x27;t embarrass her.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Rather, pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up, and don&#x27;t rebuke her.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. Then she threshed the barley she had gathered, and it amounted to about an ephah.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered.
