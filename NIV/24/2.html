youth, how as a bride you loved me and followed me through the desert, through a land not sown.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Israel was holy to the LORD, the firstfruits of his harvest; all who devoured her were held guilty, and disaster overtook them,&#x27; &quot; declares the LORD.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, all you clans of the house of Israel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">This is what the LORD says: &quot;What fault did your fathers find in me, that they strayed so far from me? They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They did not ask, &#x27;Where is the LORD, who brought us up out of Egypt and led us through the barren wilderness, through a land of deserts and rifts, a land of drought and darkness, a land where no one travels and no one lives?&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I brought you into a fertile land to eat its fruit and rich produce. But you came and defiled my land and made my inheritance detestable.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The priests did not ask, &#x27;Where is the LORD ?&#x27; Those who deal with the law did not know me; the leaders rebelled against me. The prophets prophesied by Baal, following worthless idols.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Therefore I bring charges against you again,&quot; declares the LORD. &quot;And I will bring charges against your children&#x27;s children.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Cross over to the coasts of Kittim and look, send to Kedar and observe closely; see if there has ever been anything like this:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Has a nation ever changed its gods? (Yet they are not gods at all.) But my people have exchanged their Glory for worthless idols.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Be appalled at this, O heavens, and shudder with great horror,&quot; declares the LORD.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;My people have committed two sins: They have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Is Israel a servant, a slave by birth? Why then has he become plunder?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Lions have roared; they have growled at him.

Consider then and realize how evil and bitter it is for you when you forsake the LORD your God and have no awe of me,&quot; declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Long ago you broke off your yoke and tore off your bonds; you said, &#x27;I will not serve you!&#x27; Indeed, on every high hill and under every spreading tree you lay down as a prostitute.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I had planted you like a choice vine of sound and reliable stock. How then did you turn against me into a corrupt, wild vine?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Although you wash yourself with soda and use an abundance of soap, the stain of your guilt is still before me,&quot; declares the Sovereign LORD.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;How can you say, &#x27;I am not defiled; I have not run after the Baals&#x27;?

Let them come if they can save you when you are in trouble! For you have as many gods as you have towns, O Judah.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Why do you bring charges against me? You have all rebelled against me,&quot; declares the LORD.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;In vain I punished your people; they did not respond to correction. Your sword has devoured your prophets like a ravening lion.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;You of this generation, consider the word of the LORD : &quot;Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of great darkness? Why do my people say, &#x27;We are free to roam; we will come to you no more&#x27;?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Does a maiden forget her jewelry, a bride her wedding ornaments? Yet my people have forgotten me, days without number.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">How skilled you are at pursuing love! Even the worst of women can learn from your ways.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">On your clothes men find the lifeblood of the innocent poor, though you did not catch them breaking in. Yet in spite of all this</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">you say, &#x27;I am innocent; he is not angry with me.&#x27; But I will pass judgment on you because you say, &#x27;I have not sinned.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Why do you go about so much, changing your ways? You will be disappointed by Egypt as you were by Assyria.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You will also leave that place with your hands on your head, for
