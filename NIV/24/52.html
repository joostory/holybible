His mother&#x27;s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just as Jehoiakim had done.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">It was because of the LORD&#x27;s anger that all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah, and in the end he thrust them from his presence. Now Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So in the ninth year of Zedekiah&#x27;s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. They camped outside the city and built siege works all around it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city had become so severe that there was no food for the people to eat.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the city wall was broken through, and the whole army fled. They left the city at night through the gate between the two walls near the king&#x27;s garden, though the Babylonians were surrounding the city. They fled toward the Arabah,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">but the Babylonian army pursued King Zedekiah and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his soldiers were separated from him and scattered,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and he was captured. He was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced sentence on him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">There at Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; he also killed all the officials of Judah.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he put out Zedekiah&#x27;s eyes, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon, where he put him in prison till the day of his death.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">On the tenth day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard, who served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He set fire to the temple of the LORD, the royal palace and all the houses of Jerusalem.
