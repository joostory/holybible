Kiriathaim will be disgraced and captured; the stronghold will be disgraced and shattered.</li><li>Moab will be praised no more; in Heshbon men will plot her downfall: &#x27;Come, let us put an end to that nation.&#x27; You too, O Madmen, will be silenced; the sword will pursue you.</li><li>Listen to the cries from Horonaim, cries of great havoc and destruction.</li><li>Moab will be broken; her little ones will cry out.</li><li>They go up the way to Luhith, weeping bitterly as they go; on the road down to Horonaim anguished cries over the destruction are heard.</li><li>Flee! Run for your lives; become like a bush in the desert.</li><li>Since you trust in your deeds and riches, you too will be taken captive, and Chemosh will go into exile, together with his priests and officials.</li><li>The destroyer will come against every town, and not a town will escape. The valley will be ruined and the plateau destroyed, because the LORD has spoken.</li><li>Put salt on Moab, for she will be laid waste ; her towns will become desolate, with no one to live in them.</li><li>&quot;A curse on him who is lax in doing the LORD&#x27;s work! A curse on him who keeps his sword from bloodshed!</li><li>&quot;Moab has been at rest from youth, like wine left on its dregs, not poured from one jar to another-- she has not gone into exile. So she tastes as she did, and her aroma is unchanged.</li><li>But days are coming,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;when I will send men who pour from jars, and they will pour her out; they will empty her jars and smash her jugs.</li><li>Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed when they trusted in Bethel.</li><li>&quot;How can you say, &#x27;We are warriors, men valiant in battle&#x27;?</li><li>Moab will be destroyed and her towns invaded; her finest young men will go down in the slaughter,&quot; declares the King, whose name is the LORD Almighty.</li><li>&quot;The fall of Moab is at hand; her calamity will come quickly.</li><li>Mourn for her, all who live around her, all who know her fame; say, &#x27;How broken is the mighty scepter, how broken the glorious staff!&#x27;</li><li>&quot;Come down from your glory and sit on the parched ground, O inhabitants of the Daughter of Dibon, for he who destroys Moab will come up against you and ruin your fortified cities.</li><li>Stand by the road and watch, you who live in Aroer. Ask the man fleeing and the woman escaping, ask them, &#x27;What has happened?&#x27;</li><li>Moab is disgraced, for she is shattered. Wail and cry out! Announce by the Arnon that Moab is destroyed.</li><li>Judgment has come to the plateau-- to Holon, Jahzah and Mephaath,</li><li>to Dibon, Nebo and Beth Diblathaim,</li><li>to Kiriathaim, Beth Gamul and Beth Meon,</li><li>to Kerioth and Bozrah-- to all the towns of Moab, far and near.</li><li>Moab&#x27;s horn is cut off; her arm is broken,&quot; declares the LORD.</li><li>&quot;Make her drunk, for she has defied the LORD. Let Moab wallow in her vomit; let her be an object of ridicule.</li><li>Was not Israel the object of your ridicule? Was she caught among thieves, that you shake your head in scorn whenever you speak of her?</li><li>Abandon your towns and dwell among the rocks, you who live in Moab. Be like a dove that makes its nest at the mouth of a cave.</li><li>&quot;We have heard of Moab&#x27;s pride-- her overweening pride and conceit, her pride and arrogance and the haughtiness of her heart.</li><li>I know her insolence but it is futile,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;and her boasts accomplish nothing.</li><li>Therefore I wail over Moab, for all Moab I cry out, I moan for the men of Kir Hareseth.</li><li>I weep for you, as Jazer weeps, O vines of Sibmah. Your branches spread as far as the sea; they reached as far as the sea of Jazer. The destroyer has fallen on your ripened fruit and grapes.</li><li>Joy and gladness are gone from the orchards and fields of Moab. I have stopped the flow of wine from the presses; no one treads them with shouts of joy. Although there are shouts, they are not shouts of joy.</li><li>&quot;The sound of their cry rises from Heshbon to Elealeh and Jahaz, from Zoar as far as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah, for even the waters of Nimrim are dried up.</li><li>In Moab I will put an end to those who make offerings on the high places and burn incense to their gods,&quot; declares the LORD.</li><li>&quot;So my heart laments for Moab like a flute; it laments like a flute for the men of Kir Hareseth. The wealth they acquired is gone.</li><li>Every head is shaved and every beard cut off; every hand is slashed and every waist is covered with sackcloth.</li><li>On all the roofs in Moab and in the public squares there is nothing but mourning, for I have broken Moab like a jar that no one wants,&quot; declares the LORD.</li><li>&quot;How shattered she is! How they wail! How Moab turns her back in shame! Moab has become an object of ridicule, an object of horror to all those around her.&quot;</li><li>This is what the LORD says: &quot;Look! An eagle is swooping down, spreading its wings over Moab.</li><li>Kerioth will be captured and the strongholds taken. In that day the hearts of Moab&#x27;s warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labor.</li><li>Moab will be destroyed as a nation because she defied the LORD.</li><li>Terror and pit and snare await you, O people of Moab,&quot; declares the LORD.</li><li>&quot;Whoever flees from the terror will fall into a pit, whoever climbs out of the pit will be caught in a snare; for I will bring upon Moab the year of her punishment,&quot; declares the LORD.</li><li>&quot;In the shadow of Heshbon the fugitives stand helpless, for a fire has gone out from Heshbon, a blaze from the midst of Sihon; it burns the foreheads of Moab, the skulls of the noisy boasters.</li><li>Woe to you, O Moab! The people of Chemosh are destroyed; your sons are taken into exile and your daughters into captivity.</li><li>&quot;Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab in days to come,&quot; declares the LORD.
