__className_a5c677">The army of the king of Babylon was then besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace of Judah.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him there, saying, &quot;Why do you prophesy as you do? You say, &#x27;This is what the LORD says: I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape out of the hands of the Babylonians but will certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon, and will speak with him face to face and see him with his own eyes.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, where he will remain until I deal with him, declares the LORD.

Nothing is too hard for you.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You show love to thousands but bring the punishment for the fathers&#x27; sins into the laps of their children after them.

Your eyes are open to all the ways of men; you reward everyone according to his conduct and as his deeds deserve.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You performed miraculous signs and wonders in Egypt and have continued them to this day, both in Israel and among all mankind, and have gained the renown that is still yours.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You brought your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You gave them this land you had sworn to give their forefathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey you or follow your law; they did not do what you commanded them to do. So you brought all this disaster upon them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;See how the siege ramps are built up to take the city. Because of the sword, famine and plague, the city will be handed over to the Babylonians who are attacking it.

and to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who will capture it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Babylonians who are attacking this city will come in and set it on fire; they will burn it down, along with the houses where the people provoked me to anger by burning incense on the roofs to Baal and by pouring out drink offerings to other gods.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;The people of Israel and Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight from their youth; indeed, the people of Israel have done nothing but provoke me with what their hands have made, declares the LORD.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">From the day it was built until now, this city has so aroused my anger and wrath that I must remove it from my sight.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The people of Israel and Judah have provoked me by all the evil they have done--they, their kings and officials, their priests and prophets, the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They turned their backs to me and not their faces; though I taught them again and again, they would not listen or respond to discipline.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed

__className_a5c677">They built high places for Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molech, though I never commanded, nor did it enter my mind, that they should do such a detestable thing and so make Judah sin.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;You are saying about this city, &#x27;By the sword, famine and plague it will be handed over to the king of Babylon&#x27;; but this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I will surely gather them from all the lands where I banish them in my furious anger and great wrath; I will bring them back to this place and let them live in safety.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed

everlasting covenant with them: I will never stop doing good to them, and I will inspire them to fear me, so that they will never turn away from me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed

__className_a5c677">&quot;This is what the LORD says: As I have brought all this great calamity on this people, so I will give them all the prosperity I have promised them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2
