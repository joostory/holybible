__className_7ba92c">&quot;This is what the LORD says: As I have brought all this great calamity on this people, so I will give them all the prosperity I have promised them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Once more fields will be bought in this land of which you say, &#x27;It is a desolate waste, without men or animals, for it has been handed over to
