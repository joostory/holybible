Your eyes are open to all the ways of men; you reward everyone according to his conduct and as his deeds deserve.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">You performed miraculous signs and wonders in Egypt and have continued them to this day, both in Israel and among all mankind, and have gained the renown that is still yours.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">You brought your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">You gave them this land you had sworn to give their forefathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">They came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey you or follow your law; they did not do what you commanded them to do.

Because of the sword, famine and plague, the city will be handed over to the Babylonians who are attacking it.

set it on fire; they will burn it down, along with the houses where the people provoked me to anger by burning incense on the roofs to Baal and by pouring out drink offerings to other gods.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;The people of Israel and Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight from their youth; indeed, the people of Israel have done nothing but provoke me with what their hands have made, declares the LORD.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">From the day it was built until now, this city has so aroused my anger and wrath that I must remove it from my sight.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The people of Israel and Judah have provoked me by all the evil they have done--they, their kings and officials, their priests and prophets, the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter

__className_5b4dad">They built high places for Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molech, though I never commanded, nor did it enter my mind, that they should do such a detestable thing and so make Judah sin.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;You are saying about this city, &#x27;By the sword, famine and plague it will be handed over to the king of Babylon&#x27;; but this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">I will surely gather them from all the lands where I banish them in my furious anger and great wrath; I will bring them back to this place and let them live in safety.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed

and action, so that they will always fear me for their own good and the good of their children after them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never stop doing good to them, and I will inspire them to fear me, so that they will never turn away from me.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed

__className_5b4dad">&quot;This is what the LORD says: As I have brought all this great calamity on this people, so I will give them all the prosperity I have promised them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Once more fields will be bought in this land of which you say, &#x27;It is a desolate waste, without men or animals, for it has been handed over to the Babylonians.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Fields will be bought for silver, and deeds will be signed, sealed and witnessed in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem, in the towns of Judah and in the towns of the hill country, of the western foothills and of the Negev, because I will restore their fortunes, declares the LORD.&quot;</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4 text-base gap-y-2
