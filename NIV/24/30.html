declares the LORD, &#x27;when I will bring my people Israel and Judah back from captivity and restore them to the land I gave their forefathers to possess,&#x27; says the LORD.&quot;</li><li>These are the words the LORD spoke concerning Israel and Judah:</li><li>&quot;This is what the LORD says: &quot; &#x27;Cries of fear are heard-- terror, not peace.</li><li>Ask and see: Can a man bear children? Then why do I see every strong man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor, every face turned deathly pale?</li><li>How awful that day will be! None will be like it. It will be a time of trouble for Jacob, but he will be saved out of it.</li><li>&quot; &#x27;In that day,&#x27; declares the LORD Almighty, &#x27;I will break the yoke off their necks and will tear off their bonds; no longer will foreigners enslave them.</li><li>Instead, they will serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them.</li><li>&quot; &#x27;So do not fear, O Jacob my servant; do not be dismayed, O Israel,&#x27; declares the LORD. &#x27;I will surely save you out of a distant place, your descendants from the land of their exile. Jacob will again have peace and security, and no one will make him afraid.</li><li>I am with you and will save you,&#x27; declares the LORD. &#x27;Though I completely destroy all the nations among which I scatter you, I will not completely destroy you. I will discipline you but only with justice; I will not let you go entirely unpunished.&#x27;</li><li>&quot;This is what the LORD says: &quot; &#x27;Your wound is incurable, your injury beyond healing.</li><li>There is no one to plead your cause, no remedy for your sore, no healing for you.</li><li>All your allies have forgotten you; they care nothing for you. I have struck you as an enemy would and punished you as would the cruel, because your guilt is so great and your sins so many.</li><li>Why do you cry out over your wound, your pain that has no cure? Because of your great guilt and many sins I have done these things to you.</li><li>&quot; &#x27;But all who devour you will be devoured; all your enemies will go into exile. Those who plunder you will be plundered; all who make spoil of you I will despoil.</li><li>But I will restore you to health and heal your wounds,&#x27; declares the LORD, &#x27;because you are called an outcast, Zion for whom no one cares.&#x27;</li><li>&quot;This is what the LORD says: &quot; &#x27;I will restore the fortunes of Jacob&#x27;s tents and have compassion on his dwellings; the city will be rebuilt on her ruins, and the palace will stand in its proper place.</li><li>From them will come songs of thanksgiving and the sound of rejoicing. I will add to their numbers, and they will not be decreased; I will bring them honor, and they will not be disdained.</li><li>Their children will be as in days of old, and their community will be established before me; I will punish all who oppress them.</li><li>Their leader will be one of their own; their ruler will arise from among them. I will bring him near and he will come close to me, for who is he who will devote himself to be close to me?&#x27; declares the LORD.</li><li>&quot; &#x27;So you will be my people, and I will be your God.&#x27; &quot;</li><li>See, the storm of the LORD will burst out in wrath, a driving wind swirling down on the heads of the wicked.</li><li>The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart.
