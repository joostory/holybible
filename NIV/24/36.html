the LORD&#x27;s temple.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So you go to the house of the LORD on a day of fasting and read to the people from the scroll the

Read them to all the people of Judah who come in from their towns.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Perhaps they will bring their petition before the LORD, and each will turn from his wicked ways, for the anger and wrath pronounced against this people by the LORD are great.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do; at the LORD&#x27;s temple he read the words of the LORD from the scroll.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, a time of fasting before the LORD was proclaimed for all the people in Jerusalem and those who had come from the towns of Judah.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">From the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple, Baruch read to all the people at the LORD&#x27;s temple the words of Jeremiah from the scroll.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Micaiah son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">he went down to the secretary&#x27;s room in the royal palace, where all the officials were sitting: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Acbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">After Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read to the people from the scroll,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, &quot;Bring the scroll from which you have read to the people and come.&quot; So Baruch son of Neriah went to them with the scroll in his hand.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They said to him, &quot;Sit down, please, and read it to us.&quot; So Baruch read it to them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When they heard all these words, they looked at each other in fear and said to Baruch, &quot;We must report all these words to the king.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then they asked Baruch, &quot;Tell us, how did you come to write all this?

But the LORD had hidden them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">After the king burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah&#x27;s dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Take another scroll and write on it all the words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned up.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Also tell Jehoiakim king of Judah, &#x27;This is what the LORD says: You burned that scroll and said, &quot;Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon would certainly come and destroy this land and cut off both men and animals from it?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Therefore, this is what the LORD says about Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on the throne of David; his body will be thrown out and exposed to the heat by day and the frost by night.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I will punish him and his children and his attendants for their wickedness; I will bring on them and those living in Jerusalem and the people of Judah every disaster I pronounced against them, because they have not listened.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated, Baruch wrote on it all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire.
