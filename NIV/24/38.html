leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malkijah heard what Jeremiah was telling all the people when he said,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;This is what the LORD says: &#x27;Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine or plague, but whoever goes over to the Babylonians will live. He will escape with his life; he will live.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">And this is what the LORD says: &#x27;This city will certainly be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon, who will capture it.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then the officials said to the king, &quot;This man should be put to death. He is discouraging the soldiers who are left in this city, as well as all the people, by the things he is saying to them. This man is not seeking the good of these people but their ruin.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;He is in your hands,&quot; King Zedekiah answered. &quot;The king can do nothing to oppose you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">So they took Jeremiah and put him into the cistern of Malkijah, the king&#x27;s son, which was in the courtyard of the guard. They lowered Jeremiah by ropes into the cistern; it had no water in it, only mud, and Jeremiah sank down into the mud.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">But Ebed-Melech, a Cushite, an official in the royal palace, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern. While the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Ebed-Melech went out of the palace and said to him,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all they have done to Jeremiah the prophet. They have thrown him into a cistern, where he will starve to death when there is no longer any bread in the city.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then the king commanded Ebed-Melech the Cushite, &quot;Take thirty men from here with you and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">So Ebed-Melech took the men with him and went to a room under the treasury in the palace. He took some old rags and worn-out clothes from there and let them down with ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Ebed-Melech the Cushite said to Jeremiah, &quot;Put these old rags and worn-out clothes under your arms to pad the ropes.&quot; Jeremiah did so,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">and they pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and had him brought to the third entrance to the temple of the LORD. &quot;I am going to ask you something,&quot; the king said to Jeremiah. &quot;Do not hide anything from me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, &quot;If I give you an answer, will you not kill me? Even if I did give you counsel, you would not listen to me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">But King Zedekiah swore this oath secretly to Jeremiah: &quot;As surely as the LORD lives, who has given us breath, I will neither kill you nor hand you over to those who are seeking your life.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, &quot;This is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: &#x27;If you surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, your life will be spared and this city will not be burned down; you and your family will live.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">But if you will not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, this city will be handed over to the Babylonians and they will burn it down; you yourself will not escape from their hands.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, &quot;I am afraid of the Jews who have gone over to the Babylonians, for the Babylonians may hand me over to them and they will mistreat me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;They will not hand you over,&quot; Jeremiah replied. &quot;Obey the LORD by doing what I tell you. Then it will go well with you, and your life will be spared.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">But if you refuse to surrender, this is what the LORD has revealed to me:</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">All the women left in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon. Those women will say to you: &quot; &#x27;They misled you and overcame you-- those trusted friends of yours. Your feet are sunk in the mud; your friends have deserted you.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;All your wives and children will be brought out to the Babylonians. You yourself will not escape from their hands but will be captured by the king of Babylon; and this city will be burned down.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, &quot;Do not let anyone know about this conversation, or you may die.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">If the officials hear that I talked with you, and they come to you and say, &#x27;Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us or we will kill you,&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">then tell them, &#x27;I was pleading with the king not to send me back to Jonathan&#x27;s house to die there.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">All the officials did come to Jeremiah and question him, and he told them everything the king had ordered him to say. So they said no more to him, for no one had heard his conversation with the king.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard
