At that time we had plenty of food and were well off and suffered no harm.</li><li>But ever since we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have had nothing and have been perishing by sword and famine.&quot;</li><li>The women added, &quot;When we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, did not our husbands know that we were making cakes like her image and pouring out drink offerings to her?&quot;</li><li>Then Jeremiah said to all the people, both men and women, who were answering him,</li><li>&quot;Did not the LORD remember and think about the incense burned in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem by you and your fathers, your kings and your officials and the people of the land?</li><li>When the LORD could no longer endure your wicked actions and the detestable things you did, your land became an object of cursing and a desolate waste without inhabitants, as it is today.</li><li>Because you have burned incense and have sinned against the LORD and have not obeyed him or followed his law or his decrees or his stipulations, this disaster has come upon you, as you now see.&quot;</li><li>Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including the women, &quot;Hear the word of the LORD, all you people of Judah in Egypt.</li><li>This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You and your wives have shown by your actions what you promised when you said, &#x27;We will certainly carry out the vows we made to burn incense and pour out drink offerings to the Queen of Heaven.&#x27; &quot;Go ahead then, do what you promised!
