Rescue from the hand of his oppressor the one who has been robbed. Do no wrong or violence to the alien, the fatherless or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For if you are careful to carry out these commands, then kings who sit on David&#x27;s throne will come through the gates of this palace, riding in chariots and on horses, accompanied by their officials and their people.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But if you do not obey these commands, declares the LORD, I swear by myself that this palace will become a ruin.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For this is what the LORD says about the palace of the king of Judah: &quot;Though you are like Gilead to me, like the summit of Lebanon, I will surely make you like a desert, like towns not inhabited.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I will send destroyers against you, each man with his weapons, and they will cut up your fine cedar beams and throw them into the fire.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;People from many nations will pass by this city and will ask one another, &#x27;Why has the LORD done such a thing to this great city?&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And the answer will be: &#x27;Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God and have worshiped and served other gods.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Do not weep for the dead king or mourn his loss; rather, weep bitterly for him who is exiled, because he will never return nor see his native land again.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For this is what the LORD says about Shallum son of Josiah, who succeeded his father as king of Judah but has gone from this place: &quot;He will never return.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He will die in the place where they have led him captive; he will not see this land again.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Woe to him who builds his palace by unrighteousness, his upper rooms by injustice, making his countrymen work for nothing, not paying them for their labor.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He says, &#x27;I will build myself a great palace with spacious upper rooms.&#x27; So he makes large windows in it, panels it with cedar and decorates it in red.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Does it make you a king to have more and more cedar?
