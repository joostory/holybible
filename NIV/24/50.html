They wandered over mountain and hill and forgot their own resting place.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Whoever found them devoured them; their enemies said, &#x27;We are not guilty, for they sinned against the LORD, their true pasture, the LORD, the hope of their fathers.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Flee out of Babylon; leave the land of the Babylonians, and be like the goats that lead the flock.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For I will stir up and bring against Babylon an alliance of great nations from the land of the north.

How desolate is Babylon among the nations!</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I set a trap for you, O Babylon, and you were caught before you knew it; you were found and captured because you opposed the LORD.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The LORD has opened his arsenal and brought out the weapons of his wrath, for the Sovereign LORD Almighty has work to do in the land of the Babylonians.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Come against her from afar.

They will become fools. A sword against her warriors! They will be filled with terror.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">A sword against her horses and chariots and all the foreigners in her ranks! They will become women. A sword against her treasures! They will be plundered.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">A drought on her waters! They will dry up. For it is a land of idols, idols that will go mad with terror.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;So desert creatures and hyenas will live there, and there the owl will dwell. It will never again be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah along with their neighboring towns,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;so no one will live there; no man will dwell in it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Look! An army is coming from the north; a great nation and many kings are being stirred up from the ends of the earth.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They are armed with bows and spears; they are cruel and without mercy. They sound like the roaring sea as they ride on their horses; they come like men in battle formation to attack you, O Daughter of Babylon.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The king of Babylon has heard reports about them, and his hands hang limp. Anguish has gripped him, pain like that of a woman in labor.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Like a lion coming up from Jordan&#x27;s thickets to a rich pastureland, I will chase Babylon from its land in an instant. Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this? Who is like me and who can challenge me? And what shepherd can stand against me?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Therefore, hear what the LORD has planned against Babylon, what he has purposed against the land of the Babylonians: The young of the flock will be dragged away; he will completely destroy their pasture because of them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed
