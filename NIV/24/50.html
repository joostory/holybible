They will become fools. A sword against her warriors! They will be filled with terror.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">A sword against her horses and chariots and all the foreigners in her ranks! They will become women. A sword against her treasures! They will be plundered.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">A drought on her waters! They will dry up. For it is a land of idols, idols that will go mad with terror.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">&quot;So desert creatures and hyenas will live there, and there the owl will dwell. It will never again be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah along with their neighboring towns,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;so no one will live there; no man will dwell in it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">&quot;Look! An army is coming from the north; a great nation and many kings are being stirred up from the ends of the earth.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">They are armed with bows and spears; they are cruel and without mercy. They sound like the roaring sea as they ride on their horses; they come like men in battle formation to attack you, O Daughter of Babylon.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">The king of Babylon has heard reports about them, and his hands hang limp. Anguish has gripped him, pain like that of a woman in labor.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Like a lion coming up from Jordan&#x27;s thickets to a rich pastureland, I will chase Babylon from its land in an instant. Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this? Who is like me and who can challenge me? And what shepherd can stand against me?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Therefore, hear what the LORD has planned against Babylon, what he has purposed against the land of the Babylonians: The young of the flock will be dragged away; he will completely destroy their pasture because of them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed
