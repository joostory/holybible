being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">This is what the ancients were commended for.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God&#x27;s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death; he could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith Abraham, even though he was past age--and Sarah herself was barren--was enabled to become a father because he considered him faithful who had made the promise.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance. And they admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Instead, they were longing for a better country--a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">even though God had said to him, &quot;It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead, and figuratively speaking, he did receive Isaac back from death.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph&#x27;s sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions about his bones.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith Moses&#x27; parents hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king&#x27;s edict.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king&#x27;s anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the people had marched around them for seven days.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Women received back their dead, raised to life again. Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Some faced jeers and flogging, while still others were chained and put in prison.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They were stoned; they were sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated--</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4
