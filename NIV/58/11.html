class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God&#x27;s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death; he could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By faith Abraham, even though he was past age--and Sarah herself was barren--was enabled to become a father because he considered him faithful who had made the promise.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance.

I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Women received back their dead, raised to life again. Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Some faced jeers and flogging, while still others were chained and put in prison.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They were stoned; they were sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated--</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">the world was not worthy of them.
