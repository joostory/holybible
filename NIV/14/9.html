Indeed, not even half the greatness of your wisdom was told me; you have far exceeded the report I heard.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">How happy your men must be! How happy your officials, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Praise be to the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and placed you on his throne as king to rule for the LORD your God. Because of the love of your God for Israel and his desire to uphold them forever, he has made you king over them, to maintain justice and righteousness.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, large quantities of spices, and precious stones.

On both sides of the seat were armrests, with a lion standing beside each of them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step.
