eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam, Abijah became king of Judah,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother&#x27;s name was Maacah, a daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Abijah went into battle with a force of four hundred thousand able fighting men, and Jeroboam drew up a battle line against him with eight hundred thousand able troops.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, &quot;Jeroboam and all Israel, listen to me!</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Don&#x27;t you know that the LORD, the God of Israel, has given the kingship of Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, an official of Solomon son of David, rebelled against his master.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Some worthless scoundrels gathered around him and opposed Rehoboam son of Solomon when he was young and indecisive and not strong enough to resist them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;And now you plan to resist the kingdom of the LORD, which is in the hands of David&#x27;s descendants. You are indeed a vast army and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made to be your gods.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But didn&#x27;t you drive out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and make priests of your own as the peoples of other lands do?

They set out the bread on the ceremonially clean table and light the lamps on the gold lampstand every evening. We are observing the requirements of the LORD our God. But you have forsaken him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">God is with us; he is our leader.

Then they cried out to the LORD. The priests blew their trumpets</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and the men of Judah raised the battle cry. At the sound of their battle cry, God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Israelites fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hands.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Abijah and his men inflicted heavy losses on them, so that there were five hundred thousand casualties among Israel&#x27;s able men.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The men of Israel were subdued on that occasion, and the men of Judah were victorious because they relied on the LORD, the God of their fathers.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took from him the towns of Bethel, Jeshanah and Ephron, with their surrounding villages.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jeroboam did not regain power during the time of Abijah.
