He built another wall outside that one and reinforced the supporting terraces of the City of David. He also made large numbers of weapons and shields.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He appointed military officers over the people and assembled them before him in the square at the city gate and encouraged them with these words:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria and the vast army with him, for there is a greater power with us than with him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">With him is only the arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles.&quot; And the people gained confidence from what Hezekiah the king of Judah said.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Later, when Sennacherib king of Assyria and all his forces were laying siege to Lachish, he sent his officers to Jerusalem with this message for Hezekiah king of Judah and for all the people of Judah who were there:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says: On what are you basing your confidence, that you remain in Jerusalem under siege?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Hezekiah says, &#x27;The LORD our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria,&#x27; he is misleading you, to let you die of hunger and thirst.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Did not Hezekiah himself remove this god&#x27;s high places and altars, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, &#x27;You must worship before one altar and burn sacrifices on it&#x27;?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the other lands?
