Do it now.&quot; But the Levites did not act at once.</li><li>Therefore the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him, &quot;Why haven&#x27;t you required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax imposed by Moses the servant of the LORD and by the assembly of Israel for the Tent of the Testimony?&quot;</li><li>Now the sons of that wicked woman Athaliah had broken into the temple of God and had used even its sacred objects for the Baals.</li><li>At the king&#x27;s command, a chest was made and placed outside, at the gate of the temple of the LORD.</li><li>A proclamation was then issued in Judah and Jerusalem that they should bring to the LORD the tax that Moses the servant of God had required of Israel in the desert.</li><li>All the officials and all the people brought their contributions gladly, dropping them into the chest until it was full.</li><li>Whenever the chest was brought in by the Levites to the king&#x27;s officials and they saw that there was a large amount of money, the royal secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and carry it back to its place. They did this regularly and collected a great amount of money.</li><li>The king and Jehoiada gave it to the men who carried out the work required for the temple of the LORD.

Because of their guilt, God&#x27;s anger came upon Judah and Jerusalem.</li><li>Although the LORD sent prophets to the people to bring them back to him, and though they testified against them, they would not listen.</li><li>Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest.

Because Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers, judgment was executed on Joash.</li><li>When the Arameans withdrew, they left Joash severely wounded. His officials conspired against him for murdering the son of Jehoiada the priest, and they killed him in his bed.
