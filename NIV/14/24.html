His officials conspired against him for murdering the son of Jehoiada the priest, and they killed him in his bed. So he died and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.</li><li>Those who conspired against him were Zabad, son of Shimeath an Ammonite woman, and Jehozabad, son of Shimrith a Moabite woman.</li><li>The account of his sons, the many prophecies about him, and the record of the restoration of the temple of God are written in the annotations on the book of the kings.
