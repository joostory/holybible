He then mustered those twenty years old or more and found that there were three hundred thousand men ready for military service, able to handle the spear and shield.</li><li>He also hired a hundred thousand fighting men from Israel for a hundred talents of silver.</li><li>But a man of God came to him and said, &quot;O king, these troops from Israel must not march with you, for the LORD is not with Israel--not with any of the people of Ephraim.</li><li>Even if you go and fight courageously in battle, God will overthrow you before the enemy, for God has the power to help or to overthrow.&quot;</li><li>Amaziah asked the man of God, &quot;But what about the hundred talents I paid for these Israelite troops?&quot; The man of God replied, &quot;The LORD can give you much more than that.&quot;</li><li>So Amaziah dismissed the troops who had come to him from Ephraim and sent them home.

They killed three thousand people and carried off great quantities of plunder.</li><li>When Amaziah returned from slaughtering the Edomites, he brought back the gods of the people of Seir. He set them up as his own gods, bowed down to them and burned sacrifices to them.</li><li>The anger of the LORD burned against Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him, who said, &quot;Why do you consult this people&#x27;s gods, which could not save their own people from your hand?&quot;</li><li>While he was still speaking, the king said to him, &quot;Have we appointed you an adviser to the king? Stop! Why be struck down?&quot; So the prophet stopped but said, &quot;I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel.&quot;</li><li>After Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers, he sent this challenge to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel: &quot;Come, meet me face to face.&quot;</li><li>But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: &quot;A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, &#x27;Give your daughter to my son in marriage.&#x27; Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot.</li><li>You say to yourself that you have defeated Edom, and now you are arrogant and proud.
