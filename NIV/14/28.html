twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. Unlike David his father, he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and also made cast idols for worshiping the Baals.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He burned sacrifices in the Valley of Ben Hinnom and sacrificed his sons in the fire, following the detestable ways of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places, on the hilltops and under every spreading tree.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Therefore the LORD his God handed him over to the king of Aram. The Arameans defeated him and took many of his people as prisoners and brought them to Damascus. He was also given into the hands of the king of Israel, who inflicted heavy casualties on him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In one day Pekah son of Remaliah killed a hundred and twenty thousand soldiers in Judah--because Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Zicri, an Ephraimite warrior, killed Maaseiah the king&#x27;s son, Azrikam the officer in charge of the palace, and Elkanah, second to the king.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Israelites took captive from their kinsmen two hundred thousand wives, sons and daughters. They also took a great deal of plunder, which they carried back to Samaria.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But a prophet of the LORD named Oded was there, and he went out to meet the army when it returned to Samaria. He said to them, &quot;Because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand. But you have slaughtered them in a rage that reaches to heaven.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And now you intend to make the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem your slaves. But aren&#x27;t you also guilty of sins against the LORD your God?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now listen to me! Send back your fellow countrymen you have taken as prisoners, for the LORD&#x27;s fierce anger rests on you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then some of the leaders in Ephraim--Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berekiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai--confronted those who were arriving from the war.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;You must not bring those prisoners here,&quot; they said, &quot;or we will be guilty before the LORD.

They provided them with clothes and sandals, food and drink, and healing balm. All those who were weak they put on donkeys. So they took them back to their fellow countrymen at Jericho, the City of Palms, and returned to Samaria.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At that time King Ahaz sent to the king of Assyria for help.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Edomites had again come and attacked Judah and carried away prisoners,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">while the Philistines had raided towns in the foothills and in the Negev of Judah.

He shut the doors of the LORD&#x27;s temple and set up altars at every street corner in Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In every town in Judah he built high places to burn sacrifices to other gods and provoked the LORD, the God of his fathers, to anger.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The other events of his reign and all his ways, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Ahaz rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of Jerusalem, but he was not placed in the tombs of the kings of Israel.
