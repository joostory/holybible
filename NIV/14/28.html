The Arameans defeated him and took many of his people as prisoners and brought them to Damascus. He was also given into the hands of the king of Israel, who inflicted heavy casualties on him.</li><li>In one day Pekah son of Remaliah killed a hundred and twenty thousand soldiers in Judah--because Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers.</li><li>Zicri, an Ephraimite warrior, killed Maaseiah the king&#x27;s son, Azrikam the officer in charge of the palace, and Elkanah, second to the king.</li><li>The Israelites took captive from their kinsmen two hundred thousand wives, sons and daughters. They also took a great deal of plunder, which they carried back to Samaria.</li><li>But a prophet of the LORD named Oded was there, and he went out to meet the army when it returned to Samaria. He said to them, &quot;Because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand.
