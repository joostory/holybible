And Ish-Bosheth said to Abner, &quot;Why did you sleep with my father&#x27;s concubine?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Abner was very angry because of what Ish-Bosheth said and he answered, &quot;Am I a dog&#x27;s head--on Judah&#x27;s side? This very day I am loyal to the house of your father Saul and to his family and friends. I haven&#x27;t handed you over to David. Yet now you accuse me of an offense involving this woman!</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">May God deal with Abner, be it ever so severely, if I do not do for David what the LORD promised him on oath</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">and transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and establish David&#x27;s throne over Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Ish-Bosheth did not dare to say another word to Abner, because he was afraid of him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to say to David, &quot;Whose land is it?

But I demand one thing of you: Do not come into my presence unless you bring Michal daughter of Saul when you come to see me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, demanding, &quot;Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for the price of a hundred Philistine foreskins.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">So Ish-Bosheth gave orders and had her taken away from her husband Paltiel son of Laish.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Her husband, however, went with her, weeping behind her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, &quot;Go back home!&quot; So he went back.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Abner conferred with the elders of Israel and said, &quot;For some time you have wanted to make David your king.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Now do it!

But Abner was no longer with David in Hebron, because David had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">When Joab and all the soldiers with him arrived, he was told that Abner son of Ner had come to the king and that the king had sent him away and that he had gone in peace.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">So Joab went to the king and said, &quot;What have you done?

All the people wept also.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The king sang this lament for Abner: &quot;Should Abner have died as the lawless die?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Your hands were not bound, your feet were not fettered.
