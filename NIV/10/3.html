All the people wept also.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The king sang this lament for Abner: &quot;Should Abner have died as the lawless die?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Your hands were not bound, your feet were not fettered. You fell as one falls before wicked men.&quot; And all the people wept over him again.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then they all came and urged David to eat something while it was still day; but David took an oath, saying, &quot;May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">All the people took note and were pleased; indeed, everything the king did pleased them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So on that day all the people and all Israel knew that the king had no part in the murder of Abner son of Ner.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then the king said to his men, &quot;Do you not realize that a prince and a great man has fallen in Israel this day?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And today, though I am the anointed king, I am weak, and these sons of Zeruiah are too strong for me.
