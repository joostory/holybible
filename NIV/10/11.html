They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained in Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was very beautiful,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">and David sent someone to find out about her. The man said, &quot;Isn&#x27;t this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then David sent messengers to get her. She came to him, and he slept with her. (She had purified herself from her uncleanness.) Then she went back home.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">The woman conceived and sent word to David, saying, &quot;I am pregnant.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">So David sent this word to Joab: &quot;Send me Uriah the Hittite.&quot; And Joab sent him to David.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">When Uriah came to him, David asked him how Joab was, how the soldiers were and how the war was going.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then David said to Uriah, &quot;Go down to your house and wash your feet.&quot; So Uriah left the palace, and a gift from the king was sent after him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">But Uriah slept at the entrance to the palace with all his master&#x27;s servants and did not go down to his house.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">When David was told, &quot;Uriah did not go home,&quot; he asked him, &quot;Haven&#x27;t you just come from a distance? Why didn&#x27;t you go home?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Uriah said to David, &quot;The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in tents, and my master Joab and my lord&#x27;s men are camped in the open fields. How could I go to my house to eat and drink and lie with my wife? As surely as you live, I will not do such a thing!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then David said to him, &quot;Stay here one more day, and tomorrow I will send you back.&quot; So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">At David&#x27;s invitation, he ate and drank with him, and David made him drunk.

Didn&#x27;t a woman throw an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez?

Moreover, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">David told the messenger, &quot;Say this to Joab: &#x27;Don&#x27;t let this upset you; the sword devours one as well as another.
