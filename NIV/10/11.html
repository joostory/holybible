spring, at the time when kings go off to war, David sent Joab out with the king&#x27;s men and the whole Israelite army. They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained in Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was very beautiful,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and David sent someone to find out about her. The man said, &quot;Isn&#x27;t this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then David sent messengers to get her. She came to him, and he slept with her. (She had purified herself from her uncleanness.) Then she went back home.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The woman conceived and sent word to David, saying, &quot;I am pregnant.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So David sent this word to Joab: &quot;Send me Uriah the Hittite.&quot; And Joab sent him to David.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Uriah came to him, David asked him how Joab was, how the soldiers were and how the war was going.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then David said to Uriah, &quot;Go down to your house and wash your feet.&quot; So Uriah left the palace, and a gift from the king was sent after him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Uriah slept at the entrance to the palace with all his master&#x27;s servants and did not go down to his house.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When David was told, &quot;Uriah did not go home,&quot; he asked him, &quot;Haven&#x27;t you just come from a distance? Why didn&#x27;t you go home?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Uriah said to David, &quot;The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in tents, and my master Joab and my lord&#x27;s men are camped in the open fields. How could I go to my house to eat and drink and lie with my wife? As surely as you live, I will not do such a thing!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then David said to him, &quot;Stay here one more day, and tomorrow I will send you back.&quot; So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At David&#x27;s invitation, he ate and drank with him, and David made him drunk. But in the evening Uriah went out to sleep on his mat among his master&#x27;s servants; he did not go home.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In it he wrote, &quot;Put Uriah in the front line where the fighting is fiercest. Then withdraw from him so he will be struck down and die.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So while Joab had the city under siege, he put Uriah at a place where he knew the strongest defenders were.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the men of the city came out and fought against Joab, some of the men in David&#x27;s army fell; moreover, Uriah the Hittite died.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Joab sent David a full account of the battle.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He instructed the messenger: &quot;When you have finished giving the king this account of the battle,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">the king&#x27;s anger may flare up, and he may ask you, &#x27;Why did you get so close to the city to fight? Didn&#x27;t you know they would shoot arrows from the wall?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Who killed Abimelech son of Jerub-Besheth ? Didn&#x27;t a woman throw an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you get so close to the wall?&#x27; If he asks you this, then say to him, &#x27;Also, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The messenger set out, and when he arrived he told David everything Joab had sent him to say.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The messenger said to David, &quot;The men overpowered us and came out against us in the open, but we drove them back to the entrance to the city gate.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the archers shot arrows at your servants from the wall, and some of the king&#x27;s men died. Moreover, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">David told the messenger, &quot;Say this to Joab: &#x27;Don&#x27;t let this upset you; the sword devours one as well as another. Press the attack against the city and destroy it.&#x27; Say this to encourage Joab.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Uriah&#x27;s wife heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">After the time of mourning was over, David had her brought to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son.
