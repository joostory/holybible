while he is weary and weak. I would strike him with terror, and then all the people with him will flee. I would strike down only the king</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and bring all the people back to you. The death of the man you seek will mean the return of all; all the people will be unharmed.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">This plan seemed good to Absalom and to all the elders of Israel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Absalom said, &quot;Summon also Hushai the Arkite, so we can hear what he has to say.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Hushai came to him, Absalom said, &quot;Ahithophel has given this advice. Should we do what he says? If not, give us your opinion.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Hushai replied to Absalom, &quot;The advice Ahithophel has given is not good this time.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You know your father and his men; they are fighters, and as fierce as a wild bear robbed of her cubs. Besides, your father is an experienced fighter; he will not spend the night with the troops.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Even now, he is hidden in a cave or some other place. If he should attack your troops first, whoever hears about it will say, &#x27;There has been a slaughter among the troops who follow Absalom.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then even the bravest soldier, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will melt with fear, for all Israel knows that your father is a fighter and that those with him are brave.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;So I advise you: Let all Israel, from Dan to Beersheba--as numerous as the sand on the seashore--be gathered to you, with you yourself leading them into battle.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then we will attack him wherever he may be found, and we will fall on him as dew settles on the ground. Neither he nor any of his men will be left alive.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it down to the valley until not even a piece of it can be found.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Absalom and all the men of Israel said, &quot;The advice of Hushai the Arkite is better than that of Ahithophel.&quot; For the LORD had determined to frustrate the good advice of Ahithophel in order to bring disaster on Absalom.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, &quot;Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the elders of Israel to do such and such, but I have advised them to do so and so.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now send a message immediately and tell David, &#x27;Do not spend the night at the fords in the desert; cross over without fail, or the king and all the people with him will be swallowed up.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En Rogel. A servant girl was to go and inform them, and they were to go and tell King David, for they could not risk being seen entering the city.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But a young man saw them and told Absalom. So the two of them left quickly and went to the house of a man in Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard, and they climbed down into it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">His wife took a covering and spread it out over the opening of the well and scattered grain over it. No one knew anything about it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Absalom&#x27;s men came to the woman at the house, they asked, &quot;Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?&quot; The woman answered them, &quot;They crossed over the brook.&quot; The men searched but found no one, so they returned to Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">After the men had gone, the two climbed out of the well and went to inform King David. They said to him, &quot;Set out and cross the river at once; Ahithophel has advised such and such against you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So David and all the people with him set out and crossed the Jordan. By daybreak, no one was left who had not crossed the Jordan.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and set out for his house in his hometown. He put his house in order and then hanged himself. So he died and was buried in his father&#x27;s tomb.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">David went to Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Absalom had appointed Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man named Jether, an Israelite who had married Abigail, the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah the mother of Joab.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Israelites and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and Makir son of Ammiel from Lo Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">brought bedding and bowls and articles of pottery. They also brought wheat and barley, flour and roasted grain, beans and lentils,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">honey and curds, sheep, and cheese from cows&#x27; milk for David and his people to eat.
