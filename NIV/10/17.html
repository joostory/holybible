So the two of them left quickly and went to the house of a man in Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard, and they climbed down into it.</li><li>His wife took a covering and spread it out over the opening of the well and scattered grain over it. No one knew anything about it.</li><li>When Absalom&#x27;s men came to the woman at the house, they asked, &quot;Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?&quot; The woman answered them, &quot;They crossed over the brook.&quot; The men searched but found no one, so they returned to Jerusalem.</li><li>After the men had gone, the two climbed out of the well and went to inform King David.

By daybreak, no one was left who had not crossed the Jordan.</li><li>When Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and set out for his house in his hometown. He put his house in order and then hanged himself. So he died and was buried in his father&#x27;s tomb.</li><li>David went to Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel.</li><li>Absalom had appointed Amasa over the army in place of Joab.
