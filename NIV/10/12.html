Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan, &quot;As surely as the LORD lives, the man who did this deserves to die!</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">He must pay for that lamb four times over, because he did such a thing and had no pity.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then Nathan said to David, &quot;You are the man! This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: &#x27;I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">I gave your master&#x27;s house to you, and your master&#x27;s wives into your arms.
