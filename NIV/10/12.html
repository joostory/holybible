It was like a daughter to him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan, &quot;As surely as the LORD lives, the man who did this deserves to die!</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He must pay for that lamb four times over, because he did such a thing and had no pity.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Nathan said to David, &quot;You are the man! This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: &#x27;I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">I gave your master&#x27;s house to you, and your master&#x27;s wives into your arms. I gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if all this had been too little, I would have given you even more.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Why did you despise the word of the LORD by doing what is evil in his eyes? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own. You killed him with the sword of the Ammonites.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Now, therefore, the sword will never depart from your house, because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;This is what the LORD says: &#x27;Out of your own household I am going to bring calamity upon you.

David&#x27;s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they thought, &quot;While the child was still living, we spoke to David but he would not listen to us. How can we tell him the child is dead? He may do something desperate.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">David noticed that his servants were whispering among themselves and he realized the child was dead. &quot;Is the child dead?&quot; he asked. &quot;Yes,&quot; they replied, &quot;he is dead.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then David got up from the ground. After he had washed, put on lotions and changed his clothes, he went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. Then he went to his own house, and at his request they served him food, and he ate.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">His servants asked him, &quot;Why are you acting this way? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but now that the child is dead, you get up and eat!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He answered, &quot;While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept.

Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and he went to her and lay with her. She gave birth to a son, and they named him Solomon.
