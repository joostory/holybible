reign of David, there was a famine for three successive years; so David sought the face of the LORD. The LORD said, &quot;It is on account of Saul and his blood-stained house; it is because he put the Gibeonites to death.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not a part of Israel but were survivors of the Amorites; the Israelites had sworn to spare them, but Saul in his zeal for Israel and Judah had tried to annihilate them.)</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">David asked the Gibeonites, &quot;What shall I do for you? How shall I make amends so that you will bless the LORD&#x27;s inheritance?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Gibeonites answered him, &quot;We have no right to demand silver or gold from Saul or his family, nor do we have the right to put anyone in Israel to death.&quot; &quot;What do you want me to do for you?&quot; David asked.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They answered the king, &quot;As for the man who destroyed us and plotted against us so that we have been decimated and have no place anywhere in Israel,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">let seven of his male descendants be given to us to be killed and exposed before the LORD at Gibeah of Saul--the Lord &#x27;s chosen one.&quot; So the king said, &quot;I will give them to you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The king spared Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath before the LORD between David and Jonathan son of Saul.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Aiah&#x27;s daughter Rizpah, whom she had borne to Saul, together with the five sons of Saul&#x27;s daughter Merab, whom she had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He handed them over to the Gibeonites, who killed and exposed them on a hill before the LORD.

After that, God answered prayer in behalf of the land.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Once again there was a battle between the Philistines and Israel. David went down with his men to fight against the Philistines, and he became exhausted.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And Ishbi-Benob, one of the descendants of Rapha, whose bronze spearhead weighed three hundred shekels and who was armed with a new sword , said he would kill David.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to David&#x27;s rescue; he struck the Philistine down and killed him.

him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">These four were descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men.</li></ol></div><button
