He was riding his mule, and as the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak, Absalom&#x27;s head got caught in the tree. He was left hanging in midair, while the mule he was riding kept on going.</li><li>When one of the men saw this, he told Joab, &quot;I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree.&quot;</li><li>Joab said to the man who had told him this, &quot;What!
