It would be better now for you to give us support from the city.&quot;</li><li>The king answered, &quot;I will do whatever seems best to you.&quot; So the king stood beside the gate while all the men marched out in units of hundreds and of thousands.</li><li>The king commanded Joab, Abishai and Ittai, &quot;Be gentle with the young man Absalom for my sake.&quot; And all the troops heard the king giving orders concerning Absalom to each of the commanders.</li><li>The army marched into the field to fight Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.</li><li>There the army of Israel was defeated by David&#x27;s men, and the casualties that day were great--twenty thousand men.</li><li>The battle spread out over the whole countryside, and the forest claimed more lives that day than the sword.</li><li>Now Absalom happened to meet David&#x27;s men. He was riding his mule, and as the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak, Absalom&#x27;s head got caught in the tree. He was left hanging in midair, while the mule he was riding kept on going.</li><li>When one of the men saw this, he told Joab, &quot;I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree.&quot;</li><li>Joab said to the man who had told him this, &quot;What!
