The king told the troops, &quot;I myself will surely march out with you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But the men said, &quot;You must not go out; if we are forced to flee, they won&#x27;t care about us. Even if half of us die, they won&#x27;t care; but you are worth ten thousand of us. It would be better now for you to give us support from the city.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The king answered, &quot;I will do whatever seems best to you.&quot; So the king stood beside the gate while all the men marched out in units of hundreds and of thousands.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The king commanded Joab, Abishai and Ittai, &quot;Be gentle with the young man Absalom for my sake.&quot; And all the troops heard the king giving orders concerning Absalom to each of the commanders.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The army marched into the field to fight Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">There the army of Israel was defeated by David&#x27;s men, and the casualties that day were great--twenty thousand men.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The battle spread out over the whole countryside, and the forest claimed more lives that day than the sword.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now Absalom happened to meet David&#x27;s men. He was riding his mule, and as the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak, Absalom&#x27;s head got caught in the tree. He was left hanging in midair, while the mule he was riding kept on going.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When one of the men saw this, he told Joab, &quot;I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Joab said to the man who had told him this, &quot;What! You saw him? Why didn&#x27;t you strike him to the ground right there? Then I would have had to give you ten shekels of silver and a warrior&#x27;s belt.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But the man replied, &quot;Even if a thousand shekels were weighed out into my hands, I would not lift my hand against the king&#x27;s son. In our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, &#x27;Protect the young man Absalom for my sake. &#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And if I had put my life in jeopardy --and nothing is hidden from the king--you would have kept your distance from me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Joab said, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to wait like this for you.&quot; So he took three javelins in his hand and plunged them into Absalom&#x27;s heart while Absalom was still alive in the oak tree.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And ten of Joab&#x27;s armor-bearers surrounded Absalom, struck him and killed him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and the troops stopped pursuing Israel, for Joab halted them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They took Absalom, threw him into a big pit in the forest and piled up a large heap of rocks over him. Meanwhile, all the Israelites fled to their homes.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">During his lifetime Absalom had taken a pillar and erected it in the King&#x27;s Valley as a monument to himself, for he thought, &quot;I have no son to carry on the memory of my name.&quot; He named the pillar after himself, and it is called Absalom&#x27;s Monument to this day.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, &quot;Let me run and take the news to the king that the LORD has delivered him from the hand of his enemies.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;You are not the one to take the news today,&quot; Joab told him. &quot;You may take the news another time, but you must not do so today, because the king&#x27;s son is dead.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Joab said to a Cushite, &quot;Go, tell the king what you have seen.&quot; The Cushite bowed down before Joab and ran off.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Ahimaaz son of Zadok again said to Joab, &quot;Come what may, please let me run behind the Cushite.&quot; But Joab replied, &quot;My son, why do you want to go? You don&#x27;t have any news that will bring you a reward.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He said, &quot;Come what may, I want to run.&quot; So Joab said, &quot;Run!&quot; Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and outran the Cushite.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">While David was sitting between the inner and outer gates, the watchman went up to the roof of the gateway by the wall. As he looked out, he saw a man running alone.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The watchman called out to the king and reported it. The king said, &quot;If he is alone, he must have good news.&quot; And the man came closer and closer.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the watchman saw another man running, and he called down to the gatekeeper, &quot;Look, another man running alone!&quot; The king said, &quot;He must be bringing good news, too.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The watchman said, &quot;It seems to me that the first one runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok.&quot; &quot;He&#x27;s a good man,&quot; the king said. &quot;He comes with good news.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Ahimaaz called out to the king, &quot;All is well!&quot; He bowed down before the king with his face to the ground and said, &quot;Praise be to the LORD your God! He has delivered up the men who lifted their hands against my lord the king.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The king asked, &quot;Is the young man Absalom safe?&quot; Ahimaaz answered, &quot;I saw great confusion just as Joab was about to send the king&#x27;s servant and me, your servant, but I don&#x27;t know what it was.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The king said, &quot;Stand aside and wait here.&quot; So he stepped aside and stood there.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the Cushite arrived and said, &quot;My lord the king, hear the good news! The LORD has delivered you today from all who rose up against you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The king asked the Cushite, &quot;Is the young man Absalom safe?&quot; The Cushite replied, &quot;May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up to harm you be like that young man.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The king was shaken. He went up to the room over the gateway and wept. As he went, he said: &quot;O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you--O Absalom, my son, my son!&quot;</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200
