As one of the three mighty men, he was with David when they taunted the Philistines gathered at Pas Dammim for battle. Then the men of Israel retreated,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">but he stood his ground and struck down the Philistines till his hand grew tired and froze to the sword. The LORD brought about a great victory that day. The troops returned to Eleazar, but only to strip the dead.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Next to him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines banded together at a place where there was a field full of lentils, Israel&#x27;s troops fled from them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Shammah took his stand in the middle of the field.
