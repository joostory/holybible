The LORD has handed the kingdom over to your son Absalom. You have come to ruin because you are a man of blood!&quot;</li><li>Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, &quot;Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head.&quot;</li><li>But the king said, &quot;What do you and I have in common, you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the LORD said to him, &#x27;Curse David,&#x27; who can ask, &#x27;Why do you do this?&#x27; &quot;</li><li>David then said to Abishai and all his officials, &quot;My son, who is of my own flesh, is trying to take my life. How much more, then, this Benjamite! Leave him alone; let him curse, for the LORD has told him to.</li><li>It may be that the LORD will see my distress and repay me with good for the cursing I am receiving today.&quot;</li><li>So David and his men continued along the road while Shimei was going along the hillside opposite him, cursing as he went and throwing stones at him and showering him with dirt.</li><li>The king and all the people with him arrived at their destination exhausted.
