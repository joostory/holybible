__className_5b4dad">And for the whole army the victory that day was turned into mourning, because on that day the troops heard it said, &quot;The king is grieving for his son.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The men stole into the city that day as men steal in who are ashamed when they flee from battle.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The king covered his face and cried aloud, &quot;O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Joab went into the house to the king and said, &quot;Today you have humiliated all your men, who have just saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and the lives of your wives and concubines.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">You love those who hate you and hate those who love you. You have made it clear today that the commanders and their men mean nothing to you. I see that you would be pleased if Absalom were alive today and all of us were dead.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Now go out and encourage your men. I swear by the LORD that if you don&#x27;t go out, not a man will be left with you by nightfall. This will be worse for you than all the calamities that have come upon you from your youth till now.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So the king got up and took his seat in the gateway. When the men were told, &quot;The king is sitting in the gateway,&quot; they all came before him. Meanwhile, the Israelites had fled to their homes.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Throughout the tribes of Israel, the people were all arguing with each other, saying, &quot;The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies; he is the one who rescued us from the hand of the Philistines. But now he has fled the country because of Absalom;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">and Absalom, whom we anointed to rule over us, has died in battle. So why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests: &quot;Ask the elders of Judah, &#x27;Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his palace, since what is being said throughout Israel has reached the king at his quarters?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">You are my brothers, my own flesh and blood. So why should you be the last to bring back the king?&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And say to Amasa, &#x27;Are you not my own flesh and blood? May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if from now on you are not the commander of my army in place of Joab.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He won over the hearts of all the men of Judah as though they were one man. They sent word to the king, &quot;Return, you and all your men.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then the king returned and went as far as the Jordan. Now the men of Judah had come to Gilgal to go out and meet the king and bring him across the Jordan.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">With him were a thousand Benjamites, along with Ziba, the steward of Saul&#x27;s household, and his fifteen sons and twenty servants. They rushed to the Jordan, where the king was.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">They crossed at the ford to take the king&#x27;s household over and to do whatever he wished. When Shimei son of Gera crossed the Jordan, he fell prostrate before the king</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">and said to him, &quot;May my lord not hold me guilty. Do not remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. May the king put it out of his mind.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">For I your servant know that I have sinned, but today I have come here as the first of the whole house of Joseph to come down and meet my lord the king.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said, &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t Shimei be put to death for this? He cursed the LORD&#x27;s anointed.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">David replied, &quot;What do you and I have in common, you sons of Zeruiah? This day you have become my adversaries! Should anyone be put to death in Israel today? Do I not know that today I am king over Israel?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So the king said to Shimei, &quot;You shall not die.&quot; And the king promised him on oath.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Mephibosheth, Saul&#x27;s grandson, also went down to meet the king. He had not taken care of his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned safely.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you go with me, Mephibosheth?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He said, &quot;My lord the king, since I your servant am lame, I said, &#x27;I will have my donkey saddled and will ride on it, so I can go with the king.&#x27; But Ziba my servant betrayed me.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And he has slandered your servant to my lord the king. My lord the king is like an angel of God; so do whatever pleases you.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">All my grandfather&#x27;s descendants deserved nothing but death from my lord the king, but you gave your servant a place among those who eat at your table. So what right do I have to make any more appeals to the king?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The king said to him, &quot;Why say more? I order you and Ziba to divide the fields.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Mephibosheth said to the king, &quot;Let him take everything, now that my lord the king has arrived home safely.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Barzillai the Gileadite also came down from Rogelim to cross the Jordan with the king and to send him on his way from there.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Now Barzillai was a very old man, eighty years of age. He had provided for the king during his stay in Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The king said to Barzillai, &quot;Cross over with me and stay with me in Jerusalem, and I will provide for you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But Barzillai answered the king, &quot;How many more years will I live, that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">I am now eighty years old. Can I tell the difference between what is good and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats and drinks? Can I still hear the voices of men and women singers? Why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Your servant will cross over the Jordan with the king for a short distance, but why should the king reward me in this way?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Let your servant return, that I may die in my own town near the tomb of my father and mother. But here is your servant Kimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king. Do for him whatever pleases you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The king said, &quot;Kimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him whatever pleases you. And anything you desire from me I will do for you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So all the people crossed the Jordan, and then the king crossed over. The king kissed Barzillai and gave him his blessing, and Barzillai returned to his home.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When the king crossed over to Gilgal, Kimham crossed with him. All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel had taken the king over.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Soon all the men of Israel were coming to the king and saying to him, &quot;Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, steal the king away and bring him and his household across the Jordan, together with all his men?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, &quot;We did this because the king is closely related to us. Why are you angry about it? Have we eaten any of the king&#x27;s provisions? Have we taken anything for ourselves?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, &quot;We have ten shares in the king; and besides, we have a greater claim on David than you have. So why do you treat us with contempt? Were we not the first to speak of bringing back our king?&quot; But the men of Judah responded even more harshly than the men of Israel.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4 text-base gap-y-2"><li class="__className_872c54"><a href="/NIV"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-5 w-5"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.75 19.5 8.25 12l7.5-7.5"></path></svg></a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/1">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/2">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->2</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/3">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->3</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/4">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->4</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/5">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->5</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/6">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->6</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/7">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->7</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/8">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->8</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/9">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->9</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/10">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->10</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/11">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->11</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/12">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->12</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/13">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->13</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/14">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->14</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/15">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->15</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/16">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->16</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/17">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->17</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/18">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->18</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="active" href="/NIV/10/19">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->19</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/20">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->20</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/21">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->21</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/22">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->22</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/23">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->23</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/10/24">2 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->24</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"version":{"name":"NIV","vcode":"NIV"},"bible":{"bcode":10,"chapterCount":24,"name":"2 Samuel","type":"old","vcode":"NIV"},"chapter":"19","verses":[{"bcode":10,"cnum":19,"content":"Joab was told, \"The king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.\"","vcode":"NIV","vnum":1},{"bcode":10,"cnum":19,"content":"And for the whole army the victory that day was turned into mourning, because on that day the troops heard it said, \"The king is grieving for his son.\"","vcode":"NIV","vnum":2},{"bcode":10,"cnum":19,"content":"The men stole into the city that day as men steal in who are ashamed when they flee from battle.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":3},{"bcode":10,"cnum":19,"content":"The king covered his face and cried aloud, \"O my son Absalom!
