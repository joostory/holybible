Jonadab was a very shrewd man.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He asked Amnon, &quot;Why do you, the king&#x27;s son, look so haggard morning after morning? Won&#x27;t you tell me?&quot; Amnon said to him, &quot;I&#x27;m in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom&#x27;s sister.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Go to bed and pretend to be ill,&quot; Jonadab said. &quot;When your father comes to see you, say to him, &#x27;I would like my sister Tamar to come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare the food in my sight so I may watch her and then eat it from her hand.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to him, &quot;I would like my sister Tamar to come and make some special bread in my sight, so I may eat from her hand.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">David sent word to Tamar at the palace: &quot;Go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare some food for him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, who was lying down. She took some dough, kneaded it, made the bread in his sight and baked it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then she took the pan and served him the bread, but he refused to eat. &quot;Send everyone out of here,&quot; Amnon said. So everyone left him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Amnon said to Tamar, &quot;Bring the food here into my bedroom so I may eat from your hand.&quot; And Tamar took the bread she had prepared and brought it to her brother Amnon in his bedroom.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But when she took it to him to eat, he grabbed her and said, &quot;Come to bed with me, my sister.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Don&#x27;t, my brother!&quot; she said to him. &quot;Don&#x27;t force me. Such a thing should not be done in Israel! Don&#x27;t do this wicked thing.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">What about me? Where could I get rid of my disgrace? And what about you? You would be like one of the wicked fools in Israel. Please speak to the king; he will not keep me from being married to you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But he refused to listen to her, and since he was stronger than she, he raped her.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more than he had loved her. Amnon said to her, &quot;Get up and get out!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;No!&quot; she said to him. &quot;Sending me away would be a greater wrong than what you have already done to me.&quot; But he refused to listen to her.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He called his personal servant and said, &quot;Get this woman out of here and bolt the door after her.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her. She was wearing a richly ornamented robe, for this was the kind of garment the virgin daughters of the king wore.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the ornamented robe she was wearing. She put her hand on her head and went away, weeping aloud as she went.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Her brother Absalom said to her, &quot;Has that Amnon, your brother, been with you? Be quiet now, my sister; he is your brother. Don&#x27;t take this thing to heart.&quot; And Tamar lived in her brother Absalom&#x27;s house, a desolate woman.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When King David heard all this, he was furious.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Absalom never said a word to Amnon, either good or bad; he hated Amnon because he had disgraced his sister Tamar.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Two years later, when Absalom&#x27;s sheepshearers were at Baal Hazor near the border of Ephraim, he invited all the king&#x27;s sons to come there.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Absalom went to the king and said, &quot;Your servant has had shearers come. Will the king and his officials please join me?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;No, my son,&quot; the king replied. &quot;All of us should not go; we would only be a burden to you.&quot; Although Absalom urged him, he still refused to go, but gave him his blessing.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Absalom said, &quot;If not, please let my brother Amnon come with us.&quot; The king asked him, &quot;Why should he go with you?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Absalom urged him, so he sent with him Amnon and the rest of the king&#x27;s sons.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Absalom ordered his men, &quot;Listen! When Amnon is in high spirits from drinking wine and I say to you, &#x27;Strike Amnon down,&#x27; then kill him. Don&#x27;t be afraid. Have not I given you this order? Be strong and brave.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Absalom&#x27;s men did to Amnon what Absalom had ordered. Then all the king&#x27;s sons got up, mounted their mules and fled.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">While they were on their way, the report came to David: &quot;Absalom has struck down all the king&#x27;s sons; not one of them is left.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The king stood up, tore his clothes and lay down on the ground; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Jonadab son of Shimeah, David&#x27;s brother, said, &quot;My lord should not think that they killed all the princes; only Amnon is dead. This has been Absalom&#x27;s expressed intention ever since the day Amnon raped his sister Tamar.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">My lord the king should not be concerned about the report that all the king&#x27;s sons are dead. Only Amnon is dead.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Meanwhile, Absalom had fled. Now the man standing watch looked up and saw many people on the road west of him, coming down the side of the hill. The watchman went and told the king, &quot;I see men in the direction of Horonaim, on the side of the hill.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jonadab said to the king, &quot;See, the king&#x27;s sons are here; it has happened just as your servant said.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As he finished speaking, the king&#x27;s sons came in, wailing loudly. The king, too, and all his servants wept very bitterly.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. But King David mourned for his son every day.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">After Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he stayed there three years.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And the spirit of the king longed to go to Absalom, for he was consoled concerning Amnon&#x27;s death.</li></ol></div><div
