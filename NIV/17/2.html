these beautiful girls into the harem at the citadel of Susa.

She would not return to the king unless he was pleased with her and summoned her by name.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">When the turn came for Esther (the girl Mordecai had adopted, the daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go to the king, she asked for nothing other than what Hegai, the king&#x27;s eunuch who was in charge of the harem, suggested. And Esther won the favor of everyone who saw her.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal residence in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">Now the king was attracted to Esther more than to any of the other women, and she won his favor and approval more than any of the other virgins.
