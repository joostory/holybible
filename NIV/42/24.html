of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, &quot;Why do you look for the living among the dead?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&#x27;The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then they remembered his words.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">but they were kept from recognizing him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He asked them, &quot;What are you discussing together as you walk along?&quot; They stood still, their faces downcast.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, &quot;Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;What things?&quot; he asked. &quot;About Jesus of Nazareth,&quot; they replied. &quot;He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">but didn&#x27;t find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He said to them, &quot;How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But they urged him strongly, &quot;Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.&quot; So he went in to stay with them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They asked each other, &quot;Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and saying, &quot;It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, &quot;Peace be with you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He said to them, &quot;Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, &quot;Do you have anything here to eat?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and he took it and ate it in their presence.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He said to them, &quot;This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He told them, &quot;This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You are witnesses of these things.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4 text-base
