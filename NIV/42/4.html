I know who you are--the Holy One of God!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Be quiet!&quot; Jesus said sternly. &quot;Come out of him!&quot; Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">All the people were amazed and said to each other, &quot;What is this teaching? With authority and power he gives orders to evil spirits and they come out!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon&#x27;s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the sun was setting, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, &quot;You are the Son of God!&quot; But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Christ.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At daybreak Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But he said,
