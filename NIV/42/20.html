They are God&#x27;s children, since they are children of the resurrection.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But in the account of the bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord &#x27;the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Some of the teachers of the law responded, &quot;Well said, teacher!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And no one dared to ask him any more questions.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Jesus said to them, &quot;How is it that they say the Christis the Son of David?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">David himself declares in the Book of Psalms: &quot; &#x27;The Lord said to my Lord: &quot;Sit at my right hand</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.&quot; &#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">David calls him &#x27;Lord.&#x27; How then can he be his son?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Beware of the teachers of the law.
