But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</li><li>He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed.</li><li>He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.</li><li>&quot;Then the owner of the vineyard said, &#x27;What shall I do?
