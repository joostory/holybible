Then he put the man on his own donkey, took him to an inn and took care of him.</li><li>The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper. &#x27;Look after him,&#x27; he said, &#x27;and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.&#x27;</li><li>&quot;Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?&quot;</li><li>The expert in the law replied, &quot;The one who had mercy on him.&quot; Jesus told him, &quot;Go and do likewise.&quot;</li><li>As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him.</li><li>She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord&#x27;s feet listening to what he said.</li><li>But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made.
