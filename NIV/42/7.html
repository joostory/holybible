mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1

But say the word, and my servant will be healed.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, &#x27;Go,&#x27; and he goes; and that one, &#x27;Come,&#x27; and he comes. I say to my servant, &#x27;Do this,&#x27; and he does it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, &quot;I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out--the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, &quot;Don&#x27;t cry.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then he went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. He said, &quot;Young man, I say to you, get up!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">They were all filled with awe and praised God. &quot;A great prophet has appeared among us,&quot; they said. &quot;God has come to help his people.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">John&#x27;s disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">he sent them to the Lord to ask, &quot;Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When the men came to Jesus, they said, &quot;John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, &#x27;Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So he replied to the messengers, &quot;Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">After John&#x27;s messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: &quot;What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">This is the one about whom it is written: &quot; &#x27;I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">(All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus&#x27; words, acknowledged that God&#x27;s way was right, because they had been baptized by John.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God&#x27;s purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.)</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: &quot; &#x27;We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, &#x27;He has a demon.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, &#x27;Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and &quot;sinners.&quot; &#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But wisdom is proved right by all her children.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee&#x27;s house and reclined at the table.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee&#x27;s house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">and as she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, &quot;If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is--that she is a sinner.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Jesus answered him, &quot;Simon, I have something to tell you.&quot; &quot;Tell me, teacher,&quot; he said.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;Two men owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Simon replied, &quot;I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled.&quot; &quot;You have judged correctly,&quot; Jesus said.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, &quot;Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven--for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Jesus said to her, &quot;Your sins are forgiven.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The other guests began to say among themselves, &quot;Who is this who even forgives sins?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Jesus said to the woman, &quot;Your faith has saved you; go in peace.&quot;</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4 text-base gap-y-2 w-full"><li class="__className_872c54"><a href="/NIV"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-5 w-5"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.75 19.5 8.25 12l7.5-7.5"></path></svg></a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/1">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/2">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->2</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/3">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->3</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/4">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->4</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/5">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->5</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/6">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->6</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="menu-active" href="/NIV/42/7">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->7</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/8">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->8</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/9">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->9</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/10">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->10</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/11">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->11</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/12">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->12</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/13">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->13</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/14">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->14</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/15">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->15</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/16">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->16</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/17">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->17</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/18">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->18</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/19">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->19</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/20">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->20</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/21">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->21</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/22">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->22</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/23">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->23</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/24">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->24</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"version":{"name":"NIV","vcode":"NIV"},"bible":{"bcode":42,"chapterCount":24,"name":"Luke","type":"new","vcode":"NIV"},"chapter":"7","verses":[{"bcode":42,"cnum":7,"content":"When Jesus had finished saying all this in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":1},{"bcode":42,"cnum":7,"content":"There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":2},{"bcode":42,"cnum":7,"content":"The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":3},{"bcode":42,"cnum":7,"content":"When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, \"This man deserves to have you do this,","vcode":"NIV","vnum":4},{"bcode":42,"cnum":7,"content":"because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.\"","vcode":"NIV","vnum":5},{"bcode":42,"cnum":7,"content":"So Jesus went with them.
