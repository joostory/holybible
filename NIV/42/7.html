But say the word, and my servant will be healed.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, &#x27;Go,&#x27; and he goes; and that one, &#x27;Come,&#x27; and he comes. I say to my servant, &#x27;Do this,&#x27; and he does it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, &quot;I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out--the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.

No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">But what did you go out to see? A prophet?

What are they like?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: &quot; &#x27;We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, &#x27;He has a demon.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, &#x27;Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and &quot;sinners.&quot; &#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">But wisdom is proved right by all her children.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee&#x27;s house and reclined at the table.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee&#x27;s house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">and as she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, &quot;If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is--that she is a sinner.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Jesus answered him, &quot;Simon, I have something to tell you.&quot; &quot;Tell me, teacher,&quot; he said.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;Two men owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Simon replied, &quot;I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled.&quot; &quot;You have judged correctly,&quot; Jesus said.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, &quot;Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven--for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then Jesus said to her, &quot;Your sins are forgiven.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">The other guests began to say among themselves, &quot;Who is this who even forgives sins?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Jesus said to the woman, &quot;Your faith has saved you; go in peace.&quot;</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4 text-base gap-y-2"><li class="__className_e30f19"><a href="/NIV"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" class="h-5 w-5"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.75 19.5L8.25 12l7.5-7.5"></path></svg></a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/1">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/2">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->2</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/3">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->3</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/4">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->4</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/5">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->5</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/6">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->6</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="active" href="/NIV/42/7">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->7</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/8">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->8</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/9">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->9</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/10">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->10</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/11">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->11</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/12">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->12</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/13">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->13</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/14">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->14</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/15">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->15</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/16">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->16</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/17">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->17</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/18">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->18</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/19">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->19</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/20">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->20</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/21">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->21</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/22">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->22</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/23">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->23</a></li><li class="__className_e30f19"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/24">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->24</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"version":{"name":"NIV","vcode":"NIV"},"bible":{"bcode":42,"chapterCount":24,"name":"Luke","type":"new","vcode":"NIV"},"chapter":"7","verses":[{"bcode":42,"cnum":7,"content":"When Jesus had finished saying all this in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":1},{"bcode":42,"cnum":7,"content":"There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":2},{"bcode":42,"cnum":7,"content":"The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":3},{"bcode":42,"cnum":7,"content":"When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, \"This man deserves to have you do this,","vcode":"NIV","vnum":4},{"bcode":42,"cnum":7,"content":"because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.\"","vcode":"NIV","vnum":5},{"bcode":42,"cnum":7,"content":"So Jesus went with them.
