__className_5b4dad">And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, &#x27;Grant me justice against my adversary.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed

Will he keep putting them off?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable:</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: &#x27;God, I thank you that I am not like other men--robbers, evildoers, adulterers--or even like this tax collector.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;But the tax collector stood at a distance.

Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">They told him, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He called out, &quot;Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, &quot;Son of David, have mercy on me!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him.
