However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?&quot;</li><li>To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable:</li><li>&quot;Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</li><li>The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: &#x27;God, I thank you that I am not like other men--robbers, evildoers, adulterers--or even like this tax collector.</li><li>I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.&#x27;</li><li>&quot;But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, &#x27;God, have mercy on me, a sinner.&#x27;</li><li>&quot;I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.&quot;</li><li>People were also bringing babies to Jesus to have him touch them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.</li><li>But Jesus called the children to him and said, &quot;Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</li><li>I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.&quot;</li><li>A certain ruler asked him, &quot;Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?&quot;</li><li>&quot;Why do you call me good?&quot; Jesus answered. &quot;No one is good--except God alone.</li><li>You know the commandments: &#x27;Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.&#x27;&quot;</li><li>&quot;All these I have kept since I was a boy,&quot; he said.</li><li>When Jesus heard this, he said to him, &quot;You still lack one thing.
