But finally he said to himself, &#x27;Even though I don&#x27;t fear God or care about men,</li><li>yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won&#x27;t eventually wear me out with her coming!&#x27; &quot;</li><li>And the Lord said, &quot;Listen to what the unjust judge says.</li><li>And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?</li><li>I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?&quot;</li><li>To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable:</li><li>&quot;Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</li><li>The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: &#x27;God, I thank you that I am not like other men--robbers, evildoers, adulterers--or even like this tax collector.</li><li>I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.&#x27;</li><li>&quot;But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, &#x27;God, have mercy on me, a sinner.&#x27;</li><li>&quot;I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.&quot;</li><li>People were also bringing babies to Jesus to have him touch them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.</li><li>But Jesus called the children to him and said, &quot;Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</li><li>I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.&quot;</li><li>A certain ruler asked him, &quot;Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?&quot;</li><li>&quot;Why do you call me good?&quot; Jesus answered. &quot;No one is good--except God alone.</li><li>You know the commandments: &#x27;Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.&#x27;&quot;</li><li>&quot;All these I have kept since I was a boy,&quot; he said.</li><li>When Jesus heard this, he said to him, &quot;You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.&quot;</li><li>When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was a man of great wealth.</li><li>Jesus looked at him and said, &quot;How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!</li><li>Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&quot;</li><li>Those who heard this asked, &quot;Who then can be saved?&quot;</li><li>Jesus replied, &quot;What is impossible with men is possible with God.&quot;</li><li>Peter said to him, &quot;We have left all we had to follow you!&quot;</li><li>&quot;I tell you the truth,&quot; Jesus said to them, &quot;no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God</li><li>will fail to receive many times as much in this age and, in the age to come, eternal life.&quot;</li><li>Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, &quot;We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.</li><li>He will be handed over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him, spit on him, flog him and kill him.</li><li>On the third day he will rise again.&quot;</li><li>The disciples did not understand any of this.
