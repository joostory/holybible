said: &quot;In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared about men.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, &#x27;Grant me justice against my adversary.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">&quot;For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, &#x27;Even though I don&#x27;t fear God or care about men,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won&#x27;t eventually wear me out with her coming!&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">And the Lord said, &quot;Listen to what the unjust judge says.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable:</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">&quot;Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: &#x27;God, I thank you that I am not like other men--robbers, evildoers, adulterers--or even like this tax collector.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">&quot;But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, &#x27;God, have mercy on me, a sinner.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">&quot;I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God.

When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">But Jesus called the children to him and said, &quot;Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">A certain ruler asked him, &quot;Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">&quot;Why do you call me good?&quot; Jesus answered. &quot;No one is good--except God alone.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">You know the commandments: &#x27;Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.&#x27;&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">&quot;All these I have kept since I was a boy,&quot; he said.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">When Jesus heard this, he said to him, &quot;You still lack one thing.

Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">They told him, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">He called out, &quot;Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, &quot;Son of David, have mercy on me!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him.
