his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He said: &quot;In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared about men.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, &#x27;Grant me justice against my adversary.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, &#x27;Even though I don&#x27;t fear God or care about men,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won&#x27;t eventually wear me out with her coming!&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And the Lord said, &quot;Listen to what the unjust judge says.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: &#x27;God, I thank you that I am not like other men--robbers, evildoers, adulterers--or even like this tax collector.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, &#x27;God, have mercy on me, a sinner.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">People were also bringing babies to Jesus to have him touch them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Jesus called the children to him and said, &quot;Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">A certain ruler asked him, &quot;Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Why do you call me good?&quot; Jesus answered. &quot;No one is good--except God alone.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You know the commandments: &#x27;Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.&#x27;&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;All these I have kept since I was a boy,&quot; he said.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Jesus heard this, he said to him, &quot;You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was a man of great wealth.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus looked at him and said, &quot;How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Those who heard this asked, &quot;Who then can be saved?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus replied, &quot;What is impossible with men is possible with God.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Peter said to him, &quot;We have left all we had to follow you!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;I tell you the truth,&quot; Jesus said to them, &quot;no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">will fail to receive many times as much in this age and, in the age to come, eternal life.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, &quot;We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He will be handed over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him, spit on him, flog him and kill him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">On the third day he will rise again.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They told him, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He called out, &quot;Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, &quot;Son of David, have mercy on me!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;What do you want me to do for you?&quot; &quot;Lord, I want to see,&quot; he replied.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus said to him, &quot;Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised God.</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul
