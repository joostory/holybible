tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Both of them were upright in the sight of God, observing all the Lord&#x27;s commandments and regulations blamelessly.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren; and they were both well along in years.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Once when Zechariah&#x27;s division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But the angel said to him: &quot;Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous--to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Zechariah asked the angel, &quot;How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The angel answered, &quot;I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their proper time.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When his time of service was completed, he returned home.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;The Lord has done this for me,&quot; she said. &quot;In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin&#x27;s name was Mary.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The angel went to her and said, &quot;Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But the angel said to her, &quot;Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;How will this be,&quot; Mary asked the angel, &quot;since I am a virgin?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The angel answered, &quot;The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth month.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">For nothing is impossible with God.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;I am the Lord&#x27;s servant,&quot; Mary answered. &quot;May it be to me as you have said.&quot; Then the angel left her.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">where she entered Zechariah&#x27;s home and greeted Elizabeth.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When Elizabeth heard Mary&#x27;s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">In a loud voice she exclaimed: &quot;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And Mary said: &quot;My soul glorifies the Lord</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">for the Mighty One has done great things for me-- holy is his name.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">to Abraham and his descendants forever, even as he said to our fathers.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">but his mother spoke up and said, &quot;No! He is to be called John.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">They said to her, &quot;There is no one among your relatives who has that name.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone&#x27;s astonishment he wrote, &quot;His name is John.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue was loosed, and he began to speak, praising God.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The neighbors were all filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, &quot;What then is this child going to be?&quot; For the Lord&#x27;s hand was with him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come and has redeemed his people.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">(as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us--</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">to show mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">the oath he swore to our father Abraham:</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And the child grew and became strong in spirit;
