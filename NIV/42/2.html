Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">(This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.)</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And everyone went to his own town to register.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But the angel said to them, &quot;Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &quot;Let&#x27;s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise him, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he had been conceived.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the time of their purification according to the Law of Moses had been completed, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, &quot;Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord&quot;),</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: &quot;a pair of doves or two young pigeons.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord&#x27;s Christ.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you now dismiss your servant in peace.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For my eyes have seen your salvation,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">which you have prepared in the sight of all people,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The child&#x27;s father and mother marveled at what was said about him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: &quot;This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">After the Feast was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, &quot;Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Why were you searching for me?&quot; he asked. &quot;Didn&#x27;t you know I had to be in my Father&#x27;s house?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But they did not understand what he was saying to them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.</li></ol></div><button class="absolute btn btn-soft btn-circle right-5 bottom-5 hidden lg:flex"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5"
