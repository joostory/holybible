answered, &quot;Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them--do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he told this parable: &quot;A man had a fig tree, planted in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it, but did not find any.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, &#x27;For three years now I&#x27;ve been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven&#x27;t found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot; &#x27;Sir,&#x27; the man replied, &#x27;leave it alone for one more year, and I&#x27;ll dig around it and fertilize it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, &quot;Woman, you are set free from your infirmity.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue ruler said to the people, &quot;There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Lord answered him, &quot;You hypocrites!

What shall I compare it to?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden.

Away from me, all you evildoers!&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">People will come from east and west and north and south, and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him, &quot;Leave this place and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He replied, &quot;Go tell that fox, &#x27;I will drive out demons and heal people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In any case, I must keep going today and tomorrow and the next day--for surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem!</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Look, your house is left to you desolate.
