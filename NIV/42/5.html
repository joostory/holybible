Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.</li><li>When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, &quot;Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.&quot;</li><li>Simon answered, &quot;Master, we&#x27;ve worked hard all night and haven&#x27;t caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.&quot;</li><li>When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.</li><li>So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.</li><li>When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus&#x27; knees and said, &quot;Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!&quot;</li><li>For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken,</li><li>and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon&#x27;s partners. Then Jesus said to Simon, &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid; from now on you will catch men.&quot;</li><li>So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him.</li><li>While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, &quot;Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.&quot;</li><li>Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. &quot;I am willing,&quot; he said. &quot;Be clean!&quot; And immediately the leprosy left him.</li><li>Then Jesus ordered him, &quot;Don&#x27;t tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.&quot;</li><li>Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses.</li><li>But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.</li><li>One day as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law, who had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem, were sitting there.

Who can forgive sins but God alone?&quot;</li><li>Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, &quot;Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?</li><li>Which is easier: to say, &#x27;Your sins are forgiven,&#x27; or to say, &#x27;Get up and walk&#x27;?</li><li>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins....&quot; He said to the paralyzed man, &quot;I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.&quot;</li><li>Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and went home praising God.</li><li>Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God.
