These women were helping to support them out of their own means.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable:</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds of the air ate it up.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Some fell on rock, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.&quot; When he said this, he called out, &quot;He who has ears to hear, let him hear.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">His disciples asked him what this parable meant.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He said, &quot;The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, &quot; &#x27;though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root.

Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Now Jesus&#x27; mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Someone told him, &quot;Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He replied, &quot;My mother and brothers are those who hear God&#x27;s word and put it into practice.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">One day Jesus said to his disciples, &quot;Let&#x27;s go over to the other side of the lake.&quot; So they got into a boat and set out.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The disciples went and woke him, saying, &quot;Master, Master, we&#x27;re going to drown!&quot; He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;Where is your faith?&quot; he asked his disciples. In fear and amazement they asked one another, &quot;Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, &quot;What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don&#x27;t torture me!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">For Jesus had commanded the evil spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Jesus asked him, &quot;What is your name?&quot; &quot;Legion,&quot; he replied, because many demons had gone into him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And they begged him repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into them, and he gave them permission.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus&#x27; feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;Return home and tell how much God has done for you.&quot; So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus&#x27; feet, pleading with him to come to his house</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;Who touched me?&quot; Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, &quot;Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But Jesus said, &quot;Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then he said to her, &quot;Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. &quot;Your daughter is dead,&quot; he said. &quot;Don&#x27;t bother the teacher any more.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child&#x27;s father and mother.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. &quot;Stop wailing,&quot; Jesus said. &quot;She is not dead but asleep.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But he took her by the hand and said, &quot;My child, get up!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4 text-base gap-y-2 w-full"><li class="__className_872c54"><a href="/NIV"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-5 w-5"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.75 19.5 8.25 12l7.5-7.5"></path></svg></a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/1">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/2">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->2</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/3">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->3</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/4">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->4</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/5">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->5</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/6">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->6</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/7">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->7</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="menu-active" href="/NIV/42/8">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->8</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/9">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->9</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/10">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->10</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/11">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->11</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/12">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->12</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/13">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->13</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/14">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->14</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/15">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->15</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/16">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->16</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/17">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->17</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/18">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->18</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/19">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->19</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/20">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->20</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/21">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->21</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/22">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->22</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/23">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->23</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/24">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->24</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"version":{"name":"NIV","vcode":"NIV"},"bible":{"bcode":42,"chapterCount":24,"name":"Luke","type":"new","vcode":"NIV"},"chapter":"8","verses":[{"bcode":42,"cnum":8,"content":"After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God.
