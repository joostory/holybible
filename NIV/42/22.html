class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">They were delighted and agreed to give him money.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, &quot;Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;Where do you want us to prepare for it?&quot; they asked.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed

Follow him to the house that he enters,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">and say to the owner of the house, &#x27;The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">He will show you a large upper room, all furnished. Make preparations there.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">And he said to them, &quot;I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, &quot;Take this and divide it among you.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">For I tell you I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, &quot;This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, &quot;This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed, but woe to that man who betrays him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Also a dispute arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Jesus said to them, &quot;The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">You are those who have stood by me in my trials.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift you as wheat.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">But he replied, &quot;Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Jesus answered, &quot;I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then Jesus asked them, &quot;When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?&quot; &quot;Nothing,&quot; they answered.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">He said to them, &quot;But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don&#x27;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">It is written: &#x27;And he was numbered with the transgressors&#x27;; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">The disciples said, &quot;See, Lord, here are two swords.&quot; &quot;That is enough,&quot; he replied.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">On reaching the place, he said to them, &quot;Pray that you will not fall into temptation.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">He withdrew about a stone&#x27;s throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;Why are you sleeping?&quot; he asked them. &quot;Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">but Jesus asked him, &quot;Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">When Jesus&#x27; followers saw what was going to happen, they said, &quot;Lord, should we strike with our swords?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">But Jesus answered, &quot;No more of this!&quot; And he touched the man&#x27;s ear and healed him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, &quot;Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour--when darkness reigns.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">But when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, &quot;This man was with him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">But he denied it. &quot;Woman, I don&#x27;t know him,&quot; he said.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">A little later someone else saw him and said, &quot;You also are one of them.&quot; &quot;Man, I am not!&quot; Peter replied.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">About an hour later another asserted, &quot;Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Peter replied, &quot;Man, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about!&quot; Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: &quot;Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">And he went outside and wept bitterly.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">They blindfolded him and demanded, &quot;Prophesy! Who hit you?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">And they said many other insulting things to him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;If you are the Christ,&quot; they said, &quot;tell us.&quot; Jesus answered, &quot;If I tell you, you will not believe me,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">and if I asked you, you would not answer.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">They all asked, &quot;Are you then the Son of God?&quot; He replied, &quot;You are right in saying I am.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then they said, &quot;Why do we need any more testimony?
