Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves.</li><li>For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.</li><li>You are those who have stood by me in my trials.</li><li>And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me,</li><li>so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</li><li>&quot;Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift you as wheat.</li><li>But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.&quot;</li><li>But he replied, &quot;Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.&quot;</li><li>Jesus answered, &quot;I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.&quot;</li><li>Then Jesus asked them, &quot;When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?&quot; &quot;Nothing,&quot; they answered.</li><li>He said to them, &quot;But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don&#x27;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.</li><li>It is written: &#x27;And he was numbered with the transgressors&#x27;; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment.&quot;</li><li>The disciples said, &quot;See, Lord, here are two swords.&quot; &quot;That is enough,&quot; he replied.</li><li>Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him.</li><li>On reaching the place, he said to them, &quot;Pray that you will not fall into temptation.&quot;</li><li>He withdrew about a stone&#x27;s throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed,</li><li>&quot;Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.&quot;</li><li>An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.</li><li>And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.</li><li>When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.</li><li>&quot;Why are you sleeping?&quot; he asked them. &quot;Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.&quot;</li><li>While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him,</li><li>but Jesus asked him, &quot;Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?&quot;</li><li>When Jesus&#x27; followers saw what was going to happen, they said, &quot;Lord, should we strike with our swords?&quot;</li><li>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.</li><li>But Jesus answered, &quot;No more of this!&quot; And he touched the man&#x27;s ear and healed him.</li><li>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, &quot;Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?</li><li>Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour--when darkness reigns.&quot;</li><li>Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.</li><li>But when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them.</li><li>A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, &quot;This man was with him.&quot;</li><li>But he denied it. &quot;Woman, I don&#x27;t know him,&quot; he said.</li><li>A little later someone else saw him and said, &quot;You also are one of them.&quot; &quot;Man, I am not!&quot; Peter replied.</li><li>About an hour later another asserted, &quot;Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean.&quot;</li><li>Peter replied, &quot;Man, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about!&quot; Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed.</li><li>The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: &quot;Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.&quot;</li><li>And he went outside and wept bitterly.</li><li>The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him.</li><li>They blindfolded him and demanded, &quot;Prophesy! Who hit you?&quot;</li><li>And they said many other insulting things to him.</li><li>At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them.</li><li>&quot;If you are the Christ,&quot; they said, &quot;tell us.&quot; Jesus answered, &quot;If I tell you, you will not believe me,</li><li>and if I asked you, you would not answer.</li><li>But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.&quot;</li><li>They all asked, &quot;Are you then the Son of God?&quot; He replied, &quot;You are right in saying I am.&quot;</li><li>Then they said, &quot;Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips.&quot;</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4"><li><a href="/NIV">&lt;</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/1">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/2">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->2</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/3">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->3</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/4">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->4</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/5">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->5</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/6">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->6</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/7">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->7</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/8">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->8</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/9">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->9</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/10">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->10</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/11">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->11</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/12">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->12</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/13">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->13</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/14">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->14</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/15">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->15</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/16">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->16</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/17">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->17</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/18">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->18</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/19">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->19</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/20">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->20</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/21">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->21</a></li><li><a class="active" href="/NIV/42/22">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->22</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/23">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->23</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/42/24">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->24</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"version":{"name":"NIV","vcode":"NIV"},"bible":{"bcode":42,"chapterCount":24,"name":"Luke","type":"new","vcode":"NIV"},"chapter":"22","verses":[{"bcode":42,"cnum":22,"content":"Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching,","vcode":"NIV","vnum":1},{"bcode":42,"cnum":22,"content":"and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":2},{"bcode":42,"cnum":22,"content":"Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":3},{"bcode":42,"cnum":22,"content":"And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":4},{"bcode":42,"cnum":22,"content":"They were delighted and agreed to give him money.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":5},{"bcode":42,"cnum":22,"content":"He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":6},{"bcode":42,"cnum":22,"content":"Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":7},{"bcode":42,"cnum":22,"content":"Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, \"Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.\"","vcode":"NIV","vnum":8},{"bcode":42,"cnum":22,"content":"\"Where do you want us to prepare for it?\" they asked.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":9},{"bcode":42,"cnum":22,"content":"He replied, \"As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you.
