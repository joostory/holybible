When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, &quot;Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">He said to them, &quot;When you pray, say: &quot; &#x27;Father, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Give us each day our daily bread.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And lead us not into temptation.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then he said to them, &quot;Suppose one of you has a friend, and he goes to him at midnight and says, &#x27;Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">because a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have nothing to set before him.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;Then the one inside answers, &#x27;Don&#x27;t bother me. The door is already locked, and my children are with me in bed. I can&#x27;t get up and give you anything.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">I tell you, though he will not get up and give him the bread because he is his friend, yet because of the man&#x27;s boldness he will get up and give him as much as he needs.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">But some of them said, &quot;By Beelzebub, the prince of demons, he is driving out demons.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: &quot;Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebub.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your followers drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are safe.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and divides up the spoils.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me, scatters.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;When an evil spirit comes out of a man, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, &#x27;I will return to the house I left.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that man is worse than the first.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, &quot;Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">He replied, &quot;Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">As the crowds increased, Jesus said, &quot;This is a wicked generation. It asks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon&#x27;s wisdom, and now one greater than Solomon is here.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl. Instead he puts it on its stand, so that those who come in may see the light.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are good, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are bad, your body also is full of darkness.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be completely lighted, as when the light of a lamp shines on you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he went in and reclined at the table.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">But the Pharisee, noticing that Jesus did not first wash before the meal, was surprised.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then the Lord said to him, &quot;Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">But give what is inside the dish to the poor, and everything will be clean for you.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;Woe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which men walk over without knowing it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">One of the experts in the law answered him, &quot;Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us also.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Jesus replied, &quot;And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;Woe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your forefathers who killed them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">So you testify that you approve of what your forefathers did; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Because of this, God in his wisdom said, &#x27;I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held responsible for it all.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;Woe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">When Jesus left there, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">waiting to catch him in something he might say.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4 text-base gap-y-2
