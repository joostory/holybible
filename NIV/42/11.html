praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, &quot;Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He said to them, &quot;When you pray, say: &quot; &#x27;Father, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Give us each day our daily bread.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And lead us not into temptation.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he said to them, &quot;Suppose one of you has a friend, and he goes to him at midnight and says, &#x27;Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">because a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have nothing to set before him.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Then the one inside answers, &#x27;Don&#x27;t bother me.

I can&#x27;t get up and give you anything.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I tell you, though he will not get up and give him the bread because he is his friend, yet because of the man&#x27;s boldness he will get up and give him as much as he needs.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But some of them said, &quot;By Beelzebub, the prince of demons, he is driving out demons.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: &quot;Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand?

It asks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon&#x27;s wisdom, and now one greater than Solomon is here.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl.

When your eyes are good, your whole body also is full of light.

Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But give what is inside the dish to the poor, and everything will be clean for you.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Woe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which men walk over without knowing it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">One of the experts in the law answered him, &quot;Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us also.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus replied, &quot;And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Woe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your forefathers who killed them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So you testify that you approve of what your forefathers did; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Because of this, God in his wisdom said, &#x27;I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held responsible for it all.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Woe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Jesus left there, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">waiting to catch him in
