demons and to cure diseases,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">He told them: &quot;Take nothing for the journey--no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra tunic.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">If people do not welcome you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave their town, as a testimony against them.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">So they set out and went from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed, because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">But Herod said, &quot;I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?&quot; And he tried to see him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, &quot;Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">He replied, &quot;You give them something to eat.&quot; They answered, &quot;We have only five loaves of bread and two fish--unless we go and buy food for all this crowd.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">(About five thousand men were there.) But he said to his disciples, &quot;Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">The disciples did so, and everybody sat down.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to set before the people.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, &quot;Who do the crowds say I am?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">They replied, &quot;Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">&quot;But what about you?&quot; he asked. &quot;Who do you say I am?&quot; Peter answered, &quot;The Christ of God.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">And he said, &quot;The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Then he said to them all: &quot;If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his very self?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Two men, Moses and Elijah,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus. They spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, &quot;Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters--one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.&quot; (He did not know what he was saying.)</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">A voice came from the cloud, saying, &quot;This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves, and told no one at that time what they had seen.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">A man in the crowd called out, &quot;Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">&quot;O unbelieving and perverse generation,&quot; Jesus replied, &quot;how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the evil spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">And they were all amazed at the greatness of God. While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">&quot;Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Then he said to them, &quot;Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For he who is least among you all--he is the greatest.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">&quot;Master,&quot; said John, &quot;we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">&quot;Do not stop him,&quot; Jesus said, &quot;for whoever is not against you is for you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">but the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, &quot;Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">But Jesus turned and rebuked them,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">and they went to another village.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, &quot;I will follow you wherever you go.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Jesus replied, &quot;Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">He said to another man, &quot;Follow me.&quot; But the man replied, &quot;Lord, first let me go and bury my father.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Jesus said to him, &quot;Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Still another said, &quot;I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say good-by to my family.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Jesus replied, &quot;No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.&quot;</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4 text-base gap-y-2"><li class="__className_544c10"><a href="/NIV"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" class="h-5 w-5"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.75 19.5L8.25 12l7.5-7.5"></path></svg></a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/1">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/2">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->2</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/3">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->3</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/4">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->4</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/5">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->5</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/6">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->6</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/7">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->7</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/8">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->8</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="active" href="/NIV/42/9">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->9</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/10">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->10</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/11">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->11</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/12">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->12</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/13">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->13</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/14">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->14</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/15">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->15</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/16">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->16</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/17">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->17</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/18">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->18</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/19">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->19</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/20">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->20</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/21">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->21</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/22">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->22</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/23">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->23</a></li><li class="__className_544c10"><a class="" href="/NIV/42/24">Luke<!-- --> <!-- -->24</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{"version":{"name":"NIV","vcode":"NIV"},"bible":{"bcode":42,"chapterCount":24,"name":"Luke","type":"new","vcode":"NIV"},"chapter":"9","verses":[{"bcode":42,"cnum":9,"content":"When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases,","vcode":"NIV","vnum":1},{"bcode":42,"cnum":9,"content":"and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":2},{"bcode":42,"cnum":9,"content":"He told them: \"Take nothing for the journey--no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra tunic.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":3},{"bcode":42,"cnum":9,"content":"Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":4},{"bcode":42,"cnum":9,"content":"If people do not welcome you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave their town, as a testimony against them.\"","vcode":"NIV","vnum":5},{"bcode":42,"cnum":9,"content":"So they set out and went from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":6},{"bcode":42,"cnum":9,"content":"Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on.
