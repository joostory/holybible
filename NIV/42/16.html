disciples: &quot;There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So he called him in and asked him, &#x27;What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;The manager said to himself, &#x27;What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I&#x27;m not strong enough to dig, and I&#x27;m ashamed to beg--</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I know what I&#x27;ll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;So he called in each one of his master&#x27;s debtors. He asked the first, &#x27;How much do you owe my master?&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot; &#x27;Eight hundred gallons of olive oil,&#x27; he replied. &quot;The manager told him, &#x27;Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Then he asked the second, &#x27;And how much do you owe?&#x27; &quot; &#x27;A thousand bushels of wheat,&#x27; he replied. &quot;He told him, &#x27;Take your bill and make it eight hundred.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else&#x27;s property, who will give you property of your own?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;No servant can serve two masters.

What is highly valued among men is detestable in God&#x27;s sight.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and longing to eat what fell from the rich man&#x27;s table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham&#x27;s side.

Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Abraham replied, &#x27;They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot; &#x27;No, father Abraham,&#x27; he said, &#x27;but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;He said to him, &#x27;If they do not listen to Moses and
