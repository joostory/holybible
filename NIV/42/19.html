wealthy.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He wanted to see who Jesus was, but being a short man he could not, because of the crowd.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, &quot;Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">All the people saw this and began to mutter, &quot;He has gone to be the guest of a &#x27;sinner.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, &quot;Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus said to him, &quot;Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He said: &quot;A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas.&#x27;Put this money to work,&#x27; he said, &#x27;until I come back.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, &#x27;We don&#x27;t want this man to be our king.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;He was made king, however, and returned home.

You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;His master replied, &#x27;I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in, and reaping what I did not sow?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Why then didn&#x27;t you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Then he said to those standing by, &#x27;Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot; &#x27;Sir,&#x27; they said, &#x27;he already has ten!&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;He replied, &#x27;I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them--bring them here and kill them in front of me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">After Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If anyone asks you, &#x27;Why are you untying it?&#x27; tell him, &#x27;The Lord needs it.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, &quot;Why are you untying the colt?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They replied, &quot;The Lord needs it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!&quot; &quot;Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, &quot;Teacher, rebuke your disciples!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;I tell you,&quot; he replied, &quot;if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and said, &quot;If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace--but now it is hidden from your eyes.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God&#x27;s coming to you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he entered the temple area and began driving out those who were selling.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;It is written,&quot; he said to them, &quot; &#x27;My house will be a house of prayer&#x27;; but you have made it &#x27;a den of robbers.&#x27;&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Every day he was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Yet they could
