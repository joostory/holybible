assembly rose and led him off to Pilate.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And they began to accuse him, saying, &quot;We have found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Christ, a king.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Pilate asked Jesus, &quot;Are you the king of the Jews?&quot; &quot;Yes, it is as you say,&quot; Jesus replied.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, &quot;I find no basis for a charge against this man.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But they insisted, &quot;He stirs up the people all over Judeaby his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he learned that Jesus was under Herod&#x27;s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform some miracle.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently accusing him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">That day Herod and Pilate became friends--before this they had been enemies.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and said to them, &quot;You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Therefore, I will punish him and then release him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677"></li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">With one voice they cried out, &quot;Away with this man!

Crucify him!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For the third time he spoke to them: &quot;Why? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified, and their shouts prevailed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Pilate decided to grant their demand.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As they led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus turned and said to them, &quot;Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For the time will come when you will say, &#x27;Blessed are the barren women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then &quot; &#x27;they will say to the mountains, &quot;Fall on us!&quot; and to the hills, &quot;Cover us!&quot; &#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For if men do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When they came to the place called the Skull, there they crucified him, along with the criminals--one on his right, the other on his left.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus said, &quot;Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.&quot; And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said, &quot;He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and said, &quot;If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">There was a written notice above him, which read:|sc THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: &quot;Aren&#x27;t you the Christ? Save yourself and us!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But the other criminal rebuked him. &quot;Don&#x27;t you fear God,&quot; he said, &quot;since you are under the same sentence?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he said, &quot;Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus answered him, &quot;I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus called out with a loud voice, &quot;Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.&quot; When he had said this, he breathed his last.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, &quot;Surely this was a righteous man.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea and he was waiting for the kingdom of God.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus&#x27; body.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.</li></ol></div><button class="absolute btn btn-soft btn-circle right-5 bottom-5 hidden lg:flex"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
