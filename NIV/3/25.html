Do not sow your fields or prune your vineyards.</li><li>Do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the grapes of your untended vines. The land is to have a year of rest.</li><li>Whatever the land yields during the sabbath year will be food for you--for yourself, your manservant and maidservant, and the hired worker and temporary resident who live among you,</li><li>as well as for your livestock and the wild animals in your land. Whatever the land produces may be eaten.</li><li>&quot; &#x27;Count off seven sabbaths of years--seven times seven years--so that the seven sabbaths of years amount to a period of forty-nine years.</li><li>Then have the trumpet sounded everywhere on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement sound the trumpet throughout your land.</li><li>Consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you; each one of you is to return to his family property and each to his own clan.</li><li>The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; do not sow and do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the untended vines.</li><li>For it is a jubilee and is to be holy for you; eat only what is taken directly from the fields.</li><li>&quot; &#x27;In this Year of Jubilee everyone is to return to his own property.</li><li>&quot; &#x27;If you sell land to one of your countrymen or buy any from him, do not take advantage of each other.</li><li>You are to buy from your countryman on the basis of the number of years since the Jubilee.

I am the LORD your God.</li><li>&quot; &#x27;Follow my decrees and be careful to obey my laws, and you will live safely in the land.</li><li>Then the land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live there in safety.</li><li>You may ask, &quot;What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not plant or harvest our crops?&quot;</li><li>I will send you such a blessing in the sixth year that the land will yield enough for three years.</li><li>While you plant during the eighth year, you will eat from the old crop and will continue to eat from it until the harvest of the ninth year comes in.</li><li>&quot; &#x27;The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is mine and you are but aliens and my tenants.</li><li>Throughout the country that you hold as a possession, you must provide for the redemption of the land.</li><li>&quot; &#x27;If one of your countrymen becomes poor and sells some of his property, his nearest relative is to come and redeem what his countryman has sold.</li><li>If, however, a man has no one to redeem it for him but he himself prospers and acquires sufficient means to redeem it,</li><li>he is to determine the value for the years since he sold it and refund the balance to the man to whom he sold it; he can then go back to his own property.</li><li>But if he does not acquire the means to repay him, what he sold will remain in the possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee.

One of his relatives may redeem him:</li><li>An uncle or a cousin or any blood relative in his clan may redeem him. Or if he prospers, he may redeem himself.</li><li>He and his buyer are to count the time from the year he sold himself up to the Year of Jubilee.
