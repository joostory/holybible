Do not sow your fields or prune your vineyards.</li><li>Do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the grapes of your untended vines. The land is to have a year of rest.</li><li>Whatever the land yields during the sabbath year will be food for you--for yourself, your manservant and maidservant, and the hired worker and temporary resident who live among you,</li><li>as well as for your livestock and the wild animals in your land.

It shall be a jubilee for you; each one of you is to return to his family property and each to his own clan.</li><li>The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; do not sow and do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the untended vines.</li><li>For it is a jubilee and is to be holy for you; eat only what is taken directly from the fields.</li><li>&quot; &#x27;In this Year of Jubilee everyone is to return to his own property.</li><li>&quot; &#x27;If you sell land to one of your countrymen or buy any from him, do not take advantage of each other.</li><li>You are to buy from your countryman on the basis of the number of years since the Jubilee.

One of his relatives may redeem him:</li><li>An uncle or a cousin or any blood relative in his clan may redeem him.
