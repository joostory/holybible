In order that Israel may not boast against me that her own strength has saved her,</li><li>announce now to the people, &#x27;Anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.&#x27; &quot; So twenty-two thousand men left, while ten thousand remained.</li><li>But the LORD said to Gideon, &quot;There are still too many men. Take them down to the water, and I will sift them for you there. If I say, &#x27;This one shall go with you,&#x27; he shall go; but if I say, &#x27;This one shall not go with you,&#x27; he shall not go.&quot;</li><li>So Gideon took the men down to the water.

All the rest got down on their knees to drink.</li><li>The LORD said to Gideon, &quot;With the three hundred men that lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hands. Let all the other men go, each to his own place.&quot;</li><li>So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites to their tents but kept the three hundred, who took over the provisions and trumpets of the others. Now the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley.</li><li>During that night the LORD said to Gideon, &quot;Get up, go down against the camp, because I am going to give it into your hands.</li><li>If you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah</li><li>and listen to what they are saying.
