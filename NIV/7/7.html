Take them down to the water, and I will sift them for you there. If I say, &#x27;This one shall go with you,&#x27; he shall go; but if I say, &#x27;This one shall not go with you,&#x27; he shall not go.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">So Gideon took the men down to the water. There the LORD told him, &quot;Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel down to drink.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Three hundred men lapped with their hands to their mouths. All the rest got down on their knees to drink.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The LORD said to Gideon, &quot;With the three hundred men that lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hands. Let all the other men go, each to his own place.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites to their tents but kept the three hundred, who took over the provisions and trumpets of the others. Now the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">During that night the LORD said to Gideon, &quot;Get up, go down against the camp, because I am going to give it into your hands.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">If you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">and listen to what they are saying.
