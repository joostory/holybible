Must you go to the uncircumcised Philistines to get a wife?&quot; But Samson said to his father, &quot;Get her for me.

As they approached the vineyards of Timnah, suddenly a young lion came roaring toward him.</li><li>The Spirit of the LORD came upon him in power so that he tore the lion apart with his bare hands as he might have torn a young goat.

In it was a swarm of bees and some honey,</li><li>which he scooped out with his hands and ate as he went along. When he rejoined his parents, he gave them some, and they too ate it.
