There they offered sacrifices to the LORD.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">After Joshua had dismissed the Israelites, they went to take possession of the land, each to his own inheritance.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The people served the LORD throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had seen all the great things the LORD had done for Israel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of a hundred and ten.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Heres in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">After that whole generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation grew up, who knew neither the LORD nor what he had done for Israel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD and served the Baals.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of Egypt.
