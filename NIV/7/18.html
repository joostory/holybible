Israel had no king. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking a place of their own where they might settle, because they had not yet come into an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So the Danites sent five warriors from Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land and explore it. These men represented all their clans. They told them, &quot;Go, explore the land.&quot; The men entered the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah, where they spent the night.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When they were near Micah&#x27;s house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite; so they turned in there and asked him, &quot;Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? Why are you here?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He told them what Micah had done for him, and said, &quot;He has hired me and I am his priest.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then they said to him, &quot;Please inquire of God to learn whether our journey will be successful.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The priest answered them, &quot;Go in peace. Your journey has the LORD&#x27;s approval.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So the five men left and came to Laish, where they saw that the people were living in safety, like the Sidonians, unsuspecting and secure. And since their land lacked nothing, they were prosperous. Also, they lived a long way from the Sidonians and had no relationship with anyone else.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When they returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers asked them, &quot;How did you find things?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They answered, &quot;Come on, let&#x27;s attack them! We have seen that the land is very good. Aren&#x27;t you going to do something? Don&#x27;t hesitate to go there and take it over.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When you get there, you will find an unsuspecting people and a spacious land that God has put into your hands, a land that lacks nothing whatever.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then six hundred men from the clan of the Danites, armed for battle, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">On their way they set up camp near Kiriath Jearim in Judah. This is why the place west of Kiriath Jearim is called Mahaneh Dan to this day.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">From there they went on to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah&#x27;s house.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the five men who had spied out the land of Laish said to their brothers, &quot;Do you know that one of these houses has an ephod, other household gods, a carved image and a cast idol? Now you know what to do.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So they turned in there and went to the house of the young Levite at Micah&#x27;s place and greeted him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The six hundred Danites, armed for battle, stood at the entrance to the gate.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The five men who had spied out the land went inside and took the carved image, the ephod, the other household gods and the cast idol while the priest and the six hundred armed men stood at the entrance to the gate.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When these men went into Micah&#x27;s house and took the carved image, the ephod, the other household gods and the cast idol, the priest said to them, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They answered him, &quot;Be quiet! Don&#x27;t say a word. Come with us, and be our father and priest. Isn&#x27;t it better that you serve a tribe and clan in Israel as priest rather than just one man&#x27;s household?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the priest was glad. He took the ephod, the other household gods and the carved image and went along with the people.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Putting their little children, their livestock and their possessions in front of them, they turned away and left.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When they had gone some distance from Micah&#x27;s house, the men who lived near Micah were called together and overtook the Danites.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As they shouted after them, the Danites turned and said to Micah, &quot;What&#x27;s the matter with you that you called out your men to fight?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He replied, &quot;You took the gods I made, and my priest, and went away. What else do I have? How can you ask, &#x27;What&#x27;s the matter with you?&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Danites answered, &quot;Don&#x27;t argue with us, or some hot-tempered men will attack you, and you and your family will lose your lives.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So the Danites went their way, and Micah, seeing that they were too strong for him, turned around and went back home.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then they took what Micah had made, and his priest, and went on to Laish, against a peaceful and unsuspecting people. They attacked them with the sword and burned down their city.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">There was no one to rescue them because they lived a long way from Sidon and had no relationship with anyone else. The city was in a valley near Beth Rehob. The Danites rebuilt the city and settled there.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They named it Dan after their forefather Dan, who was born to Israel--though the city used to be called Laish.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">There the Danites set up for themselves the idols, and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the time of the captivity of the land.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They continued to use the idols Micah had made, all the time the house of God was in Shiloh.</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0
