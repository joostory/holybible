Tear down your father&#x27;s altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then build a proper kind of altar to the LORD your God on the top of this height. Using the wood of the Asherah pole that you cut down, offer the second bull as a burnt offering.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the LORD told him. But because he was afraid of his family and the men of the town, he did it at night rather than in the daytime.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">In the morning when the men of the town got up, there was Baal&#x27;s altar, demolished, with the Asherah pole beside it cut down and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar!</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">They asked each other, &quot;Who did this?&quot; When they carefully investigated, they were told, &quot;Gideon son of Joash did it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The men of the town demanded of Joash, &quot;Bring out your son. He must die, because he has broken down Baal&#x27;s altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But Joash replied to the hostile crowd around him, &quot;Are you going to plead Baal&#x27;s cause? Are you trying to save him? Whoever fights for him shall be put to death by morning! If Baal really is a god, he can defend himself when someone breaks down his altar.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So that day they called Gideon &quot;Jerub-Baal, &quot; saying, &quot;Let Baal contend with him,&quot; because he broke down Baal&#x27;s altar.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Now all the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples joined forces and crossed over the Jordan and camped in the Valley of Jezreel.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, summoning the Abiezrites to follow him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, calling them to arms, and also into Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, so that they too went up to meet them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Gideon said to God, &quot;If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised-</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">look, I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you said.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And that is what happened. Gideon rose early the next day; he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew--a bowlful of water.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Gideon said to God, &quot;Do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request. Allow me one more test with the fleece. This time make the fleece dry and the ground covered with dew.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">That night God did so.
