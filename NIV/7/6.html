I drove them from before you and gave you their land.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">I said to you, &#x27;I am the LORD your God; do not worship the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live.&#x27; But you have not listened to me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The angel of the LORD came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the Midianites.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">When the angel of the LORD appeared to Gideon, he said, &quot;The LORD is with you, mighty warrior.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;But sir,&quot; Gideon replied, &quot;if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us?

Am I not sending you?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;But Lord , &quot; Gideon asked, &quot;how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The LORD answered, &quot;I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites together.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Gideon replied, &quot;If now I have found favor in your eyes, give me a sign that it is really you talking to me.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Please do not go away until I come back and bring my offering and set it before you.&quot; And the LORD said, &quot;I will wait until you return.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Gideon went in, prepared a young goat, and from an ephah of flour he made bread without yeast. Putting the meat in a basket and its broth in a pot, he brought them out and offered them to him under the oak.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The angel of God said to him, &quot;Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth.&quot; And Gideon did so.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">With the tip of the staff that was in his hand, the angel of the LORD touched the meat and the unleavened bread. Fire flared from the rock, consuming the meat and the bread. And the angel of the LORD disappeared.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the LORD, he exclaimed, &quot;Ah, Sovereign LORD! I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">But the LORD said to him, &quot;Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">So Gideon built an altar to the LORD there and called it The LORD is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">That same night the LORD said to him, &quot;Take the second bull from your father&#x27;s herd, the one seven years old. Tear down your father&#x27;s altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then build a proper kind of altar to the LORD your God on the top of this height. Using the wood of the Asherah pole that you cut down, offer the second bull as a burnt offering.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the LORD told him. But because he was afraid of his family and the men of the town, he did it at night rather than in the daytime.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">In the morning when the men of the town got up, there was Baal&#x27;s altar, demolished, with the Asherah pole beside it cut down and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar!</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">They asked each other, &quot;Who did this?&quot; When they carefully investigated, they were told, &quot;Gideon son of Joash did it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The men of the town demanded of Joash, &quot;Bring out your son. He must die, because he has broken down Baal&#x27;s altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">But Joash replied to the hostile crowd around him, &quot;Are you going to plead Baal&#x27;s cause? Are you trying to save him? Whoever fights for him shall be put to death by morning! If Baal really is a god, he can defend himself when someone breaks down his altar.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">So that day they called Gideon &quot;Jerub-Baal, &quot; saying, &quot;Let Baal contend with him,&quot; because he broke down Baal&#x27;s altar.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Now all the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples joined forces and crossed over the Jordan and camped in the Valley of Jezreel.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, summoning the Abiezrites to follow him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, calling them to arms, and also into Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, so that they too went up to meet them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Gideon said to God, &quot;If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised-</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">look, I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you said.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">And that is what happened. Gideon rose early the next day; he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew--a bowlful of water.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then Gideon said to God, &quot;Do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request. Allow me one more test with the fleece. This time make the fleece dry and the ground covered with dew.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">That night God did so.
