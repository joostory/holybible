They made no move during the night, saying, &quot;At dawn we&#x27;ll kill him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">But Samson lay there only until the middle of the night. Then he got up and took hold of the doors of the city gate, together with the two posts, and tore them loose, bar and all. He lifted them to his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Some time later, he fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said, &quot;See if you can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him so we may tie him up and subdue him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">So Delilah said to Samson, &quot;Tell me the secret of your great strength and how you can be tied up and subdued.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Samson answered her, &quot;If anyone ties me with seven fresh thongs that have not been dried, I&#x27;ll become as weak as any other man.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Then the rulers of the Philistines brought her seven fresh thongs that had not been dried, and she tied him with them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">With men hidden in the room, she called to him, &quot;Samson, the Philistines are upon you!&quot; But he snapped the thongs as easily as a piece of string snaps when it comes close to a flame. So the secret of his strength was not discovered.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Then Delilah said to Samson, &quot;You have made a fool of me; you lied to me. Come now, tell me how you can be tied.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">He said, &quot;If anyone ties me securely with new ropes that have never been used, I&#x27;ll become as weak as any other man.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them.

Tell me how you can be tied.&quot; He replied, &quot;If you weave the seven braids of my head into the fabric on the loom and tighten it with the pin, I&#x27;ll become as weak as any other man.&quot; So while he was sleeping, Delilah took the seven braids of his head, wove them into the fabric</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">and tightened it with the pin. Again she called to him, &quot;Samson, the Philistines are upon you!&quot; He awoke from his sleep and pulled up the pin and the loom, with the fabric.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Then she said to him, &quot;How can you say, &#x27;I love you,&#x27; when you won&#x27;t confide in me? This is the third time you have made a fool of me and haven&#x27;t told me the secret of your great strength.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">With such nagging she prodded him day after day until he was tired to death.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">So he told her everything. &quot;No razor has ever been used on my head,&quot; he said, &quot;because I have been a Nazirite set apart to God since birth. If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me, and I would become as weak as any other man.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">When Delilah saw that he had told her everything, she sent word to the rulers of the Philistines, &quot;Come back once more; he has told me everything.&quot; So the rulers of the Philistines returned with the silver in their hands.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Having put him to sleep on her lap, she called a man to shave off the seven braids of his hair, and so began to subdue him.

Binding him with bronze shackles, they set him to grinding in the prison.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">But the hair on his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Now the rulers of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate, saying, &quot;Our god has delivered Samson, our enemy, into our hands.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">When the people saw him, they praised their god, saying, &quot;Our god has delivered our enemy into our hands, the one who laid waste our land and multiplied our slain.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">While they were in high spirits, they shouted, &quot;Bring out Samson to entertain us.&quot; So they called Samson out of the prison, and he performed for them. When they stood him among the pillars,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Samson said to the servant who held his hand, &quot;Put me where I can feel the pillars that support the temple, so that I may lean against them.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Now the temple was crowded with men and women; all the rulers of the Philistines were there, and on the roof were about three thousand men and women watching Samson perform.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Then Samson prayed to the LORD, &quot;O Sovereign LORD, remember me. O God, please strengthen me just once more, and let me with one blow get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Then Samson reached toward the two central pillars on which the temple stood. Bracing himself against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Samson said, &quot;Let me die with the Philistines!&quot; Then he pushed with all his might, and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in it. Thus he killed many more when he died than while he lived.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Then his brothers and his father&#x27;s whole family went down to get him.
