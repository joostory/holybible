Jerub-Baal went to his mother&#x27;s brothers in Shechem and said to them and to all his mother&#x27;s clan,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Ask all the citizens of Shechem, &#x27;Which is better for you: to have all seventy of Jerub-Baal&#x27;s sons rule over you, or just one man?&#x27; Remember, I am your flesh and blood.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the brothers repeated all this to the citizens of Shechem, they were inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, &quot;He is our brother.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They gave him seventy shekels of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith, and Abimelech used it to hire reckless adventurers, who became his followers.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He went to his father&#x27;s home in Ophrah and on one stone murdered his seventy brothers, the sons of Jerub-Baal. But Jotham, the youngest son of Jerub-Baal, escaped by hiding.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then all the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo gathered beside the great tree at the pillar in Shechem to crown Abimelech king.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Jotham was told about this, he climbed up on the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted to them, &quot;Listen to me, citizens of Shechem, so that God may listen to you.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">One day the trees went out to anoint a king for themselves.

While they were eating and drinking, they cursed Abimelech.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Gaal son of Ebed said, &quot;Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should be subject to him? Isn&#x27;t he Jerub-Baal&#x27;s son, and isn&#x27;t Zebul his deputy? Serve the men of Hamor, Shechem&#x27;s father! Why should we serve Abimelech?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If only this people were under my command! Then I would get rid of him. I would say to Abimelech, &#x27;Call out your whole army!&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Zebul the governor of the city heard what Gaal son of Ebed said, he was very angry.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Under cover he sent messengers to Abimelech, saying, &quot;Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem and are stirring up the city against you.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now then, during the night you and your men should come and lie in wait in the fields.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In the morning at sunrise, advance against the city. When Gaal and his men come out against you, do whatever your hand finds to do.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Abimelech and all his troops set out by night and took up concealed positions near Shechem in four companies.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now Gaal son of Ebed had gone out and was standing at the entrance to the city gate just as Abimelech and his soldiers came out from their hiding place.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Gaal saw them, he said to Zebul, &quot;Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains!&quot; Zebul replied, &quot;You mistake the shadows of the mountains for men.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Gaal spoke up again: &quot;Look, people are coming down from the center of the land, and a company is coming from the direction of the soothsayers&#x27; tree.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Zebul said to him, &quot;Where is your big talk now, you who said, &#x27;Who is Abimelech that we should be subject to him?&#x27; Aren&#x27;t these the men you ridiculed? Go out and fight them!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Gaal led out the citizens of Shechem and fought Abimelech.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Abimelech chased him, and many fell wounded in the flight--all the way to the entrance to the gate.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Abimelech stayed in Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The next day the people of Shechem went out to the fields, and this was reported to Abimelech.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So he took his men, divided them into three companies and set an ambush in the fields. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he rose to attack them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Abimelech and the companies with him rushed forward to a position at the entrance to the city gate. Then two companies rushed upon those in the fields and struck them down.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">All that day Abimelech pressed his attack against the city until he had captured it and killed its people. Then he destroyed the city and scattered salt over it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">On hearing this, the citizens in the tower of Shechem went into the stronghold of the temple of El-Berith.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Abimelech heard that they had assembled there,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">he and all his men went up Mount Zalmon. He took an ax and cut off some branches, which he lifted to his shoulders. He ordered the men with him, &quot;Quick! Do what you have seen me do!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So all the men cut branches and followed Abimelech. They piled them against the stronghold and set it on fire over the people inside. So all the people in the tower of Shechem, about a thousand men and women, also died.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Next Abimelech went to Thebez and besieged it and captured it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Inside the city, however, was a strong tower, to which all the men and women--all the people of the city--fled. They locked themselves in and climbed up on the tower roof.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Abimelech went to the tower and stormed it. But as he approached the entrance to the tower to set it on fire,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">a woman dropped an upper millstone on his head and cracked his skull.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Hurriedly he called to his armor-bearer, &quot;Draw your sword and kill me, so that they can&#x27;t say, &#x27;A woman killed him.&#x27; &quot; So his servant ran him through, and he died.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the Israelites saw that Abimelech was dead, they went home.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Thus God repaid the wickedness that Abimelech had done to his father by murdering his seventy brothers.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">God also made the men of Shechem pay for all their wickedness. The curse of Jotham son of Jerub-Baal came on them.</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul
