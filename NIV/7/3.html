Ehud did not pull the sword out, and the fat closed in over it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then Ehud went out to the porch ; he shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">After he had gone, the servants came and found the doors of the upper room locked.

He passed by the idols and escaped to Seirah.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">When he arrived there, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went down with him from the hills, with him leading them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;Follow me,&quot; he ordered, &quot;for the LORD has given Moab, your enemy, into your hands.&quot; So they followed him down and, taking possession of the fords of the Jordan that led to Moab, they allowed no one to cross over.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">At that time they struck down about ten thousand Moabites, all vigorous and strong; not a man escaped.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">That day Moab was made subject to Israel, and the land had peace for eighty years.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">After Ehud came Shamgar son of Anath, who struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad.
