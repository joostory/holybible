Then the Israelites said, &quot;Tell us how this awful thing happened.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, said, &quot;I and my concubine came to Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">During the night the men of Gibeah came after me and surrounded the house, intending to kill me.

The fighting was so heavy that the Benjamites did not realize how near disaster was.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The LORD defeated Benjamin before Israel, and on that day the Israelites struck down 25,100 Benjamites, all armed with swords.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the Benjamites saw that they were beaten. Now the men of Israel had given way before Benjamin, because they relied on the ambush they had set near Gibeah.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The men who had been in ambush made a sudden dash into Gibeah, spread out and put the whole city to the sword.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The men of Israel had arranged with the ambush that they should send up a great cloud of smoke from the city,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and then the men of Israel would turn in the battle. The Benjamites had begun to inflict casualties on the men of Israel (about thirty), and they said, &quot;We are defeating them as in the first battle.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But when the column of smoke began to rise from the city, the Benjamites turned and saw the smoke of the whole city going up into the sky.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the men of Israel turned on them, and the men of Benjamin were terrified, because they realized that disaster had come upon them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So they fled before the Israelites in the direction of the desert, but they could not escape the battle. And the men of Israel who came out of the towns cut them down there.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them and easily overran them in the vicinity of Gibeah on the east.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Eighteen thousand Benjamites fell, all of them valiant fighters.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As they turned and fled toward the desert to the rock of Rimmon, the Israelites cut down five thousand men along the roads. They kept pressing after the Benjamites as far as Gidom and struck down two thousand more.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">On that day twenty-five thousand Benjamite swordsmen fell, all of them valiant fighters.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But six hundred men turned and fled into the desert to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed four months.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The men of Israel went back to Benjamin and put all the towns to the sword, including the animals and everything else they found.
