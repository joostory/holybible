class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Joseph said to his brothers, &quot;I am Joseph! Is my father still living?&quot; But his brothers were not able to answer him, because they were terrified at his presence.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Joseph said to his brothers, &quot;Come close to me.&quot; When they had done so, he said, &quot;I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt!</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For two years now there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years there will not be plowing and reaping.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God.
