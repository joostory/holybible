and spoke tenderly to her.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And Shechem said to his father Hamor, &quot;Get me this girl as my wife.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had been defiled, his sons were in the fields with his livestock; so he kept quiet about
