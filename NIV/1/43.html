How were we to know he would say, &#x27;Bring your brother down here&#x27;?&quot;</li><li>Then Judah said to Israel his father, &quot;Send the boy along with me and we will go at once, so that we and you and our children may live and not die.</li><li>I myself will guarantee his safety; you can hold me personally responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him here before you, I will bear the blame before you all my life.</li><li>As it is, if we had not delayed, we could have gone and returned twice.&quot;</li><li>Then their father Israel said to them, &quot;If it must be, then do this: Put some of the best products of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift--a little balm and a little honey, some spices and myrrh, some pistachio nuts and almonds.</li><li>Take double the amount of silver with you, for you must return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks.

They thought, &quot;We were brought here because of the silver that was put back into our sacks the first time.
