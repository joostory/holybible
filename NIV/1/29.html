Then we will water the sheep.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father&#x27;s sheep, for she was a shepherdess.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of Laban, his mother&#x27;s brother, and Laban&#x27;s sheep, he went over and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle&#x27;s sheep.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep aloud.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">He had told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of Rebekah. So she ran and told her father.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister&#x27;s son, he hurried to meet him.

So Jacob said to Laban, &quot;What is this you have done to me? I served you for Rachel, didn&#x27;t I? Why have you deceived me?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Laban replied, &quot;It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Finish this daughter&#x27;s bridal week; then we will give you the younger one also, in return for another seven years of work.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">And Jacob did so. He finished the week with Leah, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Laban gave his servant girl Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maidservant.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Jacob lay with Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah. And he worked for Laban another seven years.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">When the LORD saw that Leah was not loved, he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, for she said, &quot;It is because the LORD has seen my misery. Surely my husband will love me now.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, &quot;Because the LORD heard that I am not loved, he gave me this one too.&quot; So she named him Simeon.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Again she conceived, and when she gave birth to a son she said, &quot;Now at last my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.&quot; So he was named Levi.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, &quot;This time I will praise the LORD.&quot; So she named him Judah.
