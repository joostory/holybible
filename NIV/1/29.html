The stone over the mouth of the well was large.</li><li>When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone away from the well&#x27;s mouth and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well.</li><li>Jacob asked the shepherds, &quot;My brothers, where are you from?&quot; &quot;We&#x27;re from Haran,&quot; they replied.</li><li>He said to them, &quot;Do you know Laban, Nahor&#x27;s grandson?&quot; &quot;Yes, we know him,&quot; they answered.</li><li>Then Jacob asked them, &quot;Is he well?&quot; &quot;Yes, he is,&quot; they said, &quot;and here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Look,&quot; he said, &quot;the sun is still high; it is not time for the flocks to be gathered. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture.&quot;</li><li>&quot;We can&#x27;t,&quot; they replied, &quot;until all the flocks are gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep.&quot;</li><li>While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father&#x27;s sheep, for she was a shepherdess.</li><li>When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of Laban, his mother&#x27;s brother, and Laban&#x27;s sheep, he went over and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle&#x27;s sheep.</li><li>Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep aloud.</li><li>He had told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of Rebekah. So she ran and told her father.</li><li>As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister&#x27;s son, he hurried to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home, and there Jacob told him all these things.</li><li>Then Laban said to him, &quot;You are my own flesh and blood.&quot; After Jacob had stayed with him for a whole month,</li><li>Laban said to him, &quot;Just because you are a relative of mine, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.&quot;</li><li>Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.</li><li>Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel was lovely in form, and beautiful.</li><li>Jacob was in love with Rachel and said, &quot;I&#x27;ll work for you seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel.&quot;</li><li>Laban said, &quot;It&#x27;s better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay here with me.&quot;</li><li>So Jacob served seven years to get Rachel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.</li><li>Then Jacob said to Laban, &quot;Give me my wife.

So Jacob said to Laban, &quot;What is this you have done to me? I served you for Rachel, didn&#x27;t I? Why have you deceived me?&quot;</li><li>Laban replied, &quot;It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one.</li><li>Finish this daughter&#x27;s bridal week; then we will give you the younger one also, in return for another seven years of work.&quot;</li><li>And Jacob did so. He finished the week with Leah, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.</li><li>Laban gave his servant girl Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maidservant.</li><li>Jacob lay with Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah. And he worked for Laban another seven years.</li><li>When the LORD saw that Leah was not loved, he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.</li><li>Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, for she said, &quot;It is because the LORD has seen my misery. Surely my husband will love me now.&quot;</li><li>She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, &quot;Because the LORD heard that I am not loved, he gave me this one too.&quot; So she named him Simeon.</li><li>Again she conceived, and when she gave birth to a son she said, &quot;Now at last my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.&quot; So he was named Levi.</li><li>She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, &quot;This time I will praise the LORD.&quot; So she named him Judah.
