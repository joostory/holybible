Water the sheep and take them back to pasture.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;We can&#x27;t,&quot; they replied, &quot;until all the flocks are gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father&#x27;s sheep, for she was a shepherdess.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of Laban, his mother&#x27;s brother, and Laban&#x27;s sheep, he went over and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle&#x27;s sheep.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep aloud.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He had told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of Rebekah. So she ran and told her father.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister&#x27;s son, he hurried to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home, and there Jacob told him all these things.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Laban said to him, &quot;You are my own flesh and blood.&quot; After Jacob had stayed with him for a whole month,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Laban said to him, &quot;Just because you are a relative of mine, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel was lovely in form, and beautiful.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Jacob was in love with Rachel and said, &quot;I&#x27;ll work for you seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Laban said, &quot;It&#x27;s better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay here with me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So Jacob served seven years to get Rachel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Jacob said to Laban, &quot;Give me my wife. My time is completed, and I want to lie with her.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So Laban brought together all the people of the place and gave a feast.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But when evening came, he took his daughter Leah and gave her to Jacob, and Jacob lay with her.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And Laban gave his servant girl Zilpah to his daughter as her maidservant.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When morning came, there was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, &quot;What is this you have done to me? I served you for Rachel, didn&#x27;t I? Why have you deceived me?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Laban replied, &quot;It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Finish this daughter&#x27;s bridal week; then we will give you the younger one also, in return for another seven years of work.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And Jacob did so. He finished the week with Leah, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Laban gave his servant girl Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maidservant.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Jacob lay with Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah. And he worked for Laban another seven years.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When the LORD saw that Leah was not loved, he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, for she said, &quot;It is because the LORD has seen my misery. Surely my husband will love me now.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, &quot;Because the LORD heard that I am not loved, he gave me this one too.&quot; So she named him Simeon.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Again she conceived, and when she gave birth to a son she said, &quot;Now at last my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.&quot; So he was named Levi.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, &quot;This time I will praise the LORD.&quot; So she named him Judah. Then she stopped having children.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4
