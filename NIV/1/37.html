the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">This is the account of Jacob. Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father&#x27;s wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age; and he made a richly ornamented robe for him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He said to them, &quot;Listen to this dream I had:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">His brothers said to him, &quot;Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?&quot; And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. &quot;Listen,&quot; he said, &quot;I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, &quot;What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now his brothers had gone to graze their father&#x27;s flocks near Shechem,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and Israel said to Joseph, &quot;As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them.&quot; &quot;Very well,&quot; he replied.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So he said to him, &quot;Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me.&quot; Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. When Joseph arrived at Shechem,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, &quot;What are you looking for?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He replied, &quot;I&#x27;m looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;They have moved on from here,&quot; the man answered. &quot;I heard them say, &#x27;Let&#x27;s go to Dothan.&#x27; &quot; So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Here comes that dreamer!&quot; they said to each other.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Come now, let&#x27;s kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we&#x27;ll see what comes of his dreams.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. &quot;Let&#x27;s not take his life,&quot; he said.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Don&#x27;t shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the desert, but don&#x27;t lay a hand on him.&quot; Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe--the richly ornamented robe he was wearing-</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and they took him and threw him into the cistern. Now the cistern was empty; there was no water in it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Judah said to his brothers, &quot;What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Come, let&#x27;s sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.&quot; His brothers agreed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He went back to his brothers and said, &quot;The boy isn&#x27;t there! Where can I turn now?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then they got Joseph&#x27;s robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They took the ornamented robe back to their father and said, &quot;We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son&#x27;s robe.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He recognized it and said, &quot;It is my son&#x27;s robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. &quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;in mourning will I go down to the grave to my son.&quot; So his father wept for him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh&#x27;s officials, the captain of the guard.</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto
