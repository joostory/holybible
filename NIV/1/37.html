Come, I am going to send you to them.&quot; &quot;Very well,&quot; he replied.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So he said to him, &quot;Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me.&quot; Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. When Joseph arrived at Shechem,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, &quot;What are you looking for?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He replied, &quot;I&#x27;m looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;They have moved on from here,&quot; the man answered. &quot;I heard them say, &#x27;Let&#x27;s go to Dothan.&#x27; &quot; So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;Here comes that dreamer!&quot; they said to each other.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;Come now, let&#x27;s kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him.

Now the cistern was empty; there was no water in it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Judah said to his brothers, &quot;What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Come, let&#x27;s sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.&quot; His brothers agreed.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He went back to his brothers and said, &quot;The boy isn&#x27;t there! Where can I turn now?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then they got Joseph&#x27;s robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">They took the ornamented robe back to their father and said, &quot;We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son&#x27;s robe.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He recognized it and said, &quot;It is my son&#x27;s robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. &quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;in mourning will I go down to the grave to my son.&quot; So his father wept for him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh&#x27;s officials, the captain of the guard.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto
