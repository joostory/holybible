Do not be angry with your servant, though you are equal to Pharaoh himself.</li><li>My lord asked his servants, &#x27;Do you have a father or a brother?&#x27;</li><li>And we answered, &#x27;We have an aged father, and there is a young son born to him in his old age. His brother is dead, and he is the only one of his mother&#x27;s sons left, and his father loves him.&#x27;</li><li>&quot;Then you said to your servants, &#x27;Bring him down to me so I can see him for myself.&#x27;</li><li>And we said to my lord, &#x27;The boy cannot leave his father; if he leaves him, his father will die.&#x27;</li><li>But you told your servants, &#x27;Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.&#x27;</li><li>When we went back to your servant my father, we told him what my lord had said.</li><li>&quot;Then our father said, &#x27;Go back and buy a little more food.&#x27;</li><li>But we said, &#x27;We cannot go down. Only if our youngest brother is with us will we go. We cannot see the man&#x27;s face unless our youngest brother is with us.&#x27;</li><li>&quot;Your servant my father said to us, &#x27;You know that my wife bore me two sons.</li><li>One of them went away from me, and I said, &quot;He has surely been torn to pieces.&quot; And I have not seen him since.</li><li>If you take this one from me too and harm comes to him, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in misery.&#x27;</li><li>&quot;So now, if the boy is not with us when I go back to your servant my father and if my father, whose life is closely bound up with the boy&#x27;s life,</li><li>sees that the boy isn&#x27;t there, he will die.
