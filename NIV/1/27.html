I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing.&quot;</li><li>His mother said to him, &quot;My son, let the curse fall on me. Just do what I say; go and get them for me.&quot;</li><li>So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked it.</li><li>Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob.</li><li>She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins.</li><li>Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made.</li><li>He went to his father and said, &quot;My father.&quot; &quot;Yes, my son,&quot; he answered. &quot;Who is it?&quot;</li><li>Jacob said to his father, &quot;I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game so that you may give me your blessing.&quot;</li><li>Isaac asked his son, &quot;How did you find it so quickly, my son?&quot; &quot;The LORD your God gave me success,&quot; he replied.</li><li>Then Isaac said to Jacob, &quot;Come near so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not.&quot;</li><li>Jacob went close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, &quot;The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.&quot;</li><li>He did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he blessed him.</li><li>&quot;Are you really my son Esau?&quot; he asked. &quot;I am,&quot; he replied.</li><li>Then he said, &quot;My son, bring me some of your game to eat, so that I may give you my blessing.&quot; Jacob brought it to him and he ate; and he brought some wine and he drank.</li><li>Then his father Isaac said to him, &quot;Come here, my son, and kiss me.&quot;</li><li>So he went to him and kissed him.

Then he said to him, &quot;My father, sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.&quot;</li><li>His father Isaac asked him, &quot;Who are you?&quot; &quot;I am your son,&quot; he answered, &quot;your firstborn, Esau.&quot;</li><li>Isaac trembled violently and said, &quot;Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him--and indeed he will be blessed!&quot;</li><li>When Esau heard his father&#x27;s words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, &quot;Bless me--me too, my father!&quot;</li><li>But he said, &quot;Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.&quot;</li><li>Esau said, &quot;Isn&#x27;t he rightly named Jacob ? He has deceived me these two times: He took my birthright, and now he&#x27;s taken my blessing!&quot; Then he asked, &quot;Haven&#x27;t you reserved any blessing for me?&quot;</li><li>Isaac answered Esau, &quot;I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?&quot;</li><li>Esau said to his father, &quot;Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!&quot; Then Esau wept aloud.</li><li>His father Isaac answered him, &quot;Your dwelling will be away from the earth&#x27;s richness, away from the dew of heaven above.</li><li>You will live by the sword and you will serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will throw his yoke from off your neck.&quot;</li><li>Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, &quot;The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob.&quot;</li><li>When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, &quot;Your brother Esau is consoling himself with the thought of killing you.</li><li>Now then, my son, do what I say: Flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran.</li><li>Stay with him for a while until your brother&#x27;s fury subsides.</li><li>When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him, I&#x27;ll send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?&quot;</li><li>Then Rebekah said to Isaac, &quot;I&#x27;m disgusted with living because of these Hittite women.
