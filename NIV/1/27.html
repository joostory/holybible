I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">His mother said to him, &quot;My son, let the curse fall on me. Just do what I say; go and get them for me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He went to his father and said, &quot;My father.&quot; &quot;Yes, my son,&quot; he answered. &quot;Who is it?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jacob said to his father, &quot;I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me.

Be lord over your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed and those who bless you be blessed.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">After Isaac finished blessing him and Jacob had scarcely left his father&#x27;s presence, his brother Esau came in from hunting.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He too prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Then he said to him, &quot;My father, sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">His father Isaac asked him, &quot;Who are you?&quot; &quot;I am your son,&quot; he answered, &quot;your firstborn, Esau.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Isaac trembled violently and said, &quot;Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him--and indeed he will be blessed!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Esau heard his father&#x27;s words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, &quot;Bless me--me too, my father!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But he said, &quot;Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Esau said, &quot;Isn&#x27;t he rightly named Jacob ? He has deceived me these two times: He took my birthright, and now he&#x27;s taken my blessing!&quot; Then he asked, &quot;Haven&#x27;t you reserved any blessing for me?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Isaac answered Esau, &quot;I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Esau said to his father, &quot;Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!&quot; Then Esau wept aloud.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">His father Isaac answered him, &quot;Your dwelling will be away from the earth&#x27;s richness, away from the dew of heaven above.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You will live by the sword and you will serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will throw his yoke from off your neck.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, &quot;The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, &quot;Your brother Esau is consoling himself with the thought of killing you.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now then, my son, do what I say: Flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Stay with him for a while until your brother&#x27;s fury subsides.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him, I&#x27;ll send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Rebekah said to Isaac, &quot;I&#x27;m disgusted with living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from among the women of this land, from Hittite women like these, my life will not be worth living.&quot;</li></ol></div><button class="absolute btn btn-soft btn-circle right-5
