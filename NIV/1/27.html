When Esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Rebekah said to her son Jacob, &quot;Look, I overheard your father say to your brother Esau,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&#x27;Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat, so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the LORD before I die.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Now, my son, listen carefully and do what I tell you:</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so I can prepare some tasty food for your father, just the way he likes it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may give you his blessing before he dies.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, &quot;But my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I&#x27;m a man with smooth skin.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">What if my father touches me? I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">His mother said to him, &quot;My son, let the curse fall on me. Just do what I say; go and get them for me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He went to his father and said, &quot;My father.&quot; &quot;Yes, my son,&quot; he answered. &quot;Who is it?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Jacob said to his father, &quot;I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game so that you may give me your blessing.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Isaac asked his son, &quot;How did you find it so quickly, my son?&quot; &quot;The LORD your God gave me success,&quot; he replied.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Isaac said to Jacob, &quot;Come near so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Jacob went close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, &quot;The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he blessed him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;Are you really my son Esau?&quot; he asked. &quot;I am,&quot; he replied.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then he said, &quot;My son, bring me some of your game to eat, so that I may give you my blessing.&quot; Jacob brought it to him and he ate; and he brought some wine and he drank.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then his father Isaac said to him, &quot;Come here, my son, and kiss me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So he went to him and kissed him. When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said, &quot;Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">May God give you of heaven&#x27;s dew and of earth&#x27;s richness-- an abundance of grain and new wine.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">May nations serve you and peoples bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed and those who bless you be blessed.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">After Isaac finished blessing him and Jacob had scarcely left his father&#x27;s presence, his brother Esau came in from hunting.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He too prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Then he said to him, &quot;My father, sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">His father Isaac asked him, &quot;Who are you?&quot; &quot;I am your son,&quot; he answered, &quot;your firstborn, Esau.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Isaac trembled violently and said, &quot;Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him--and indeed he will be blessed!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When Esau heard his father&#x27;s words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, &quot;Bless me--me too, my father!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But he said, &quot;Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Esau said, &quot;Isn&#x27;t he rightly named Jacob ? He has deceived me these two times: He took my birthright, and now he&#x27;s taken my blessing!&quot; Then he asked, &quot;Haven&#x27;t you reserved any blessing for me?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Isaac answered Esau, &quot;I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Esau said to his father, &quot;Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!&quot; Then Esau wept aloud.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">His father Isaac answered him, &quot;Your dwelling will be away from the earth&#x27;s richness, away from the dew of heaven above.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">You will live by the sword and you will serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will throw his yoke from off your neck.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, &quot;The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, &quot;Your brother Esau is consoling himself with the thought of killing you.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Now then, my son, do what I say: Flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Stay with him for a while until your brother&#x27;s fury subsides.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him, I&#x27;ll send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Rebekah said to Isaac, &quot;I&#x27;m disgusted with living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from among the women of this land, from Hittite women like these, my life will not be worth living.&quot;</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute
