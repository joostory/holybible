continued, &quot;I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then ten of Joseph&#x27;s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph&#x27;s brother, with the others, because he was afraid that harm might come to him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Israel&#x27;s sons were among those who went to buy grain, for the famine was in the land of Canaan also.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now Joseph was the governor of the land, the one who sold grain to all its people. So when Joseph&#x27;s brothers arrived, they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. &quot;Where do you come from?&quot; he asked. &quot;From the land of Canaan,&quot; they replied, &quot;to buy food.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he remembered his dreams about them and said to them, &quot;You are spies! You have come to see where our land is unprotected.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;No, my lord,&quot; they answered. &quot;Your servants have come to buy food.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">We are all the sons of one man. Your servants are honest men, not spies.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;No!&quot; he said to them. &quot;You have come to see where our land is unprotected.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But they replied, &quot;Your servants were twelve brothers, the sons of one man, who lives in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no more.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Joseph said to them, &quot;It is just as I told you: You are spies!</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And this is how you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Send one of your number to get your brother; the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth. If you are not, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And he put them all in custody for three days.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">On the third day, Joseph said to them, &quot;Do this and you will live, for I fear God:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here in prison, while the rest of you go and take grain back for your starving households.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But you must bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words may be verified and that you may not die.&quot; This they proceeded to do.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They said to one another, &quot;Surely we are being punished because of our brother. We saw how distressed he was when he pleaded with us for his life, but we would not listen; that&#x27;s why this distress has come upon us.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Reuben replied, &quot;Didn&#x27;t I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldn&#x27;t listen! Now we must give an accounting for his blood.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They did not realize that Joseph could understand them, since he was using an interpreter.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He turned away from them and began to weep, but then turned back and spoke to them again. He had Simeon taken from them and bound before their eyes.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to put each man&#x27;s silver back in his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey.

They said,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;The man who is lord over the land spoke harshly to us and treated us as though we were spying on the land.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But we said to him, &#x27;We are honest men; we are not spies.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">We were twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in Canaan.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Then the man who is lord over the land said to us, &#x27;This is how I will know whether you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take food for your starving households and go.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But bring your youngest brother to me so I will know that you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you, and you can trade in the land.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As they were emptying their sacks, there in each man&#x27;s sack was his pouch of silver! When they and their father saw the money pouches, they were frightened.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Their father Jacob said to them, &quot;You have deprived me of my children. Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Reuben said to his father, &quot;You may put both of my sons to death if I do not bring him back to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him back.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Jacob said, &quot;My son will not go down there with you; his brother is dead and he is the only one left. If harm comes to him on the journey you are taking, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in sorrow.&quot;</li></ol></div><button class="absolute btn btn-soft btn-circle right-5 bottom-5
