him in every way.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">He said to the chief servant in his household, the one in charge of all that he had, &quot;Put your hand under my thigh.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">I want you to swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am living,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">The servant asked him, &quot;What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;Make sure that you do not take my son back there,&quot; Abraham said.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;The LORD, the God of heaven, who brought me out of my father&#x27;s household and my native land and who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, &#x27;To your offspring I will give this land&#x27;-he will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then the servant took ten of his master&#x27;s camels and left, taking with him all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim and made his way to the town of Nahor.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town; it was toward evening, the time the women go out to draw water.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then he prayed, &quot;O LORD, God of my master Abraham, give me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">May it be that when I say to a girl, &#x27;Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,&#x27; and she says, &#x27;Drink, and I&#x27;ll water your camels too&#x27;-let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, who was the wife of Abraham&#x27;s brother Nahor.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">The girl was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had ever lain with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar and came up again.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">The servant hurried to meet her and said, &quot;Please give me a little water from your jar.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;Drink, my lord,&quot; she said, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">After she had given him a drink, she said, &quot;I&#x27;ll draw water for your camels too, until they have finished drinking.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the LORD had made his journey successful.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then he asked, &quot;Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father&#x27;s house for us to spend the night?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">She answered him, &quot;I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milcah bore to Nahor.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">And she added, &quot;We have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for you to spend the night.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then the man bowed down and worshiped the LORD,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">saying, &quot;Praise be to the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master&#x27;s relatives.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">The girl ran and told her mother&#x27;s household about these things.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he hurried out to the man at the spring.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">As soon as he had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister&#x27;s arms, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;Come, you who are blessed by the LORD,&quot; he said. &quot;Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the camels, and water for him and his men to wash their feet.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then food was set before him, but he said, &quot;I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say.&quot; &quot;Then tell us,&quot; Laban said.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">So he said, &quot;I am Abraham&#x27;s servant.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">The LORD has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become wealthy. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, menservants and maidservants, and camels and donkeys.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">My master&#x27;s wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">And my master made me swear an oath, and said, &#x27;You must not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">but go to my father&#x27;s family and to my own clan, and get a wife for my son.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;Then I asked my master, &#x27;What if the woman will not come back with me?&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;He replied, &#x27;The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you can get a wife for my son from my own clan and from my father&#x27;s family.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then, when you go to my clan, you will be released from my oath even if they refuse to give her to you--you will be released from my oath.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;When I came to the spring today, I said, &#x27;O LORD, God of my master Abraham, if you will, please grant success to the journey on which I have come.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">See, I am standing beside this spring; if a maiden comes out to draw water and I say to her, &quot;Please let me drink a little water from your jar,&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">and if she says to me, &quot;Drink, and I&#x27;ll draw water for your camels too,&quot; let her be the one the LORD has chosen for my master&#x27;s son.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;Before I finished praying in my heart, Rebekah came out, with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, &#x27;Please give me a drink.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, &#x27;Drink, and I&#x27;ll water your camels too.&#x27; So I drank, and she watered the camels also.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;I asked her, &#x27;Whose daughter are you?&#x27; &quot;She said, &#x27;The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.&#x27; &quot;Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">and I bowed down and worshiped the LORD. I praised the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my master&#x27;s brother for his son.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so I may know which way to turn.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Laban and Bethuel answered, &quot;This is from the LORD; we can say nothing to you one way or the other.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master&#x27;s son, as the LORD has directed.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">When Abraham&#x27;s servant heard what they said, he bowed down to the ground before the LORD.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then the servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there. When they got up the next morning, he said, &quot;Send me on my way to my master.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">But her brother and her mother replied, &quot;Let the girl remain with us ten days or so; then you may go.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">But he said to them, &quot;Do not detain me, now that the LORD has granted success to my journey. Send me on my way so I may go to my master.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then they said, &quot;Let&#x27;s call the girl and ask her about it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">So they called Rebekah and asked her, &quot;Will you go with this man?&quot; &quot;I will go,&quot; she said.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham&#x27;s servant and his men.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, &quot;Our sister, may you increase to thousands upon thousands; may your offspring possess the gates of their enemies.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then Rebekah and her maids got ready and mounted their camels and went back with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi, for he was living in the Negev.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">He went out to the field one evening to meditate, and as he looked up, he saw camels approaching.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She got down from her camel</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">and asked the servant, &quot;Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?&quot; &quot;He is my master,&quot; the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then the servant told Isaac all he had done.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he married Rebekah. So she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother&#x27;s death.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60
