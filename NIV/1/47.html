So now, please let your servants settle in Goshen.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Pharaoh said to Joseph, &quot;Your father and your brothers have come to you,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">and the land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best part of the land.
