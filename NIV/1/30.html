I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He added, &quot;Name your wages, and I will pay them.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jacob said to him, &quot;You know how I have worked for you and how your livestock has fared under my care.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The little you had before I came has increased greatly, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I have been. But now, when may I do something for my own household?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;What shall I give you?&quot; he asked. &quot;Don&#x27;t give me anything,&quot; Jacob replied. &quot;But if you will do this one thing for me, I will go on tending your flocks and watching over them:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb and every spotted or speckled goat. They will be my wages.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And my honesty will testify for me in the future, whenever you check on the wages you have paid me. Any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted, or any lamb that is not dark-colored, will be considered stolen.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Agreed,&quot; said Laban. &quot;Let it be as you have said.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">That same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted, and all the speckled or spotted female goats (all that had white on them) and all the dark-colored lambs, and he placed them in the care of his sons.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban&#x27;s flocks.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jacob, however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond and plane trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he placed the peeled branches in all the watering troughs, so that they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink. When the flocks were in heat and came to drink,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jacob set apart the young of the flock by themselves, but made the rest face the streaked and dark-colored animals that belonged to Laban. Thus he made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with Laban&#x27;s animals.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Whenever the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">but if the animals were weak, he would not place them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks, and maidservants and menservants, and camels and donkeys.</li></ol></div><button class="absolute btn btn-soft btn-circle right-5 bottom-5 hidden lg:flex"><svg
