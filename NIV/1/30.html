When the flocks were in heat and came to drink,</li><li>they mated in front of the branches.

Thus he made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with Laban&#x27;s animals.</li><li>Whenever the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches,</li><li>but if the animals were weak, he would not place them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob.</li><li>In this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks, and maidservants and menservants, and camels and donkeys.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4"><li><a href="/NIV">&lt;</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/1">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/2">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->2</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/3">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->3</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/4">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->4</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/5">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->5</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/6">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->6</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/7">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->7</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/8">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->8</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/9">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->9</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/10">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->10</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/11">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->11</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/12">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->12</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/13">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->13</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/14">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->14</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/15">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->15</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/16">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->16</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/17">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->17</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/18">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->18</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/19">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->19</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/20">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->20</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/21">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->21</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/22">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->22</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/23">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->23</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/24">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->24</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/25">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->25</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/26">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->26</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/27">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->27</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/28">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->28</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/29">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->29</a></li><li><a class="active" href="/NIV/1/30">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->30</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/31">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->31</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/32">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->32</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/33">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->33</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/34">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->34</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/35">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->35</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/36">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->36</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/37">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->37</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/38">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->38</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/39">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->39</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/40">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->40</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/41">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->41</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/42">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->42</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/43">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->43</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/44">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->44</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/45">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->45</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/46">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->46</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/47">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->47</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/48">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->48</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/49">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->49</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/1/50">Genesis<!-- --> <!-- -->50</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"version":{"name":"NIV","vcode":"NIV"},"bible":{"bcode":1,"chapterCount":50,"name":"Genesis","type":"old","vcode":"NIV"},"chapter":"30","verses":[{"bcode":1,"cnum":30,"content":"When Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob any children, she became jealous of her sister.
