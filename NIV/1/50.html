So the physicians embalmed him,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">taking a full forty days, for that was the time required for embalming. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the days of mourning had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh&#x27;s court, &quot;If I have found favor in your eyes, speak to Pharaoh for me. Tell him,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&#x27;My father made me swear an oath and said, &quot;I am about to die; bury me in the tomb I dug for myself in the land of Canaan.&quot; Now let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Pharaoh said, &quot;Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear to do.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Joseph went up to bury his father.
