leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing by the Nile,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">when out of the river there came up seven cows, sleek and fat, and they grazed among the reeds.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">After them, seven other cows, ugly and gaunt, came up out of the Nile and stood beside those on the riverbank.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And the cows that were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He fell asleep again and had a second dream: Seven heads of grain, healthy and good, were growing on a single stalk.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted--thin and scorched by the east wind.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy, full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up; it had been a dream.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">In the morning his mind was troubled, so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, &quot;Today I am reminded of my shortcomings.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Each of us had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my position, and the other man was hanged. &quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the dungeon. When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Pharaoh said to Joseph, &quot;I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;I cannot do it,&quot; Joseph replied to Pharaoh, &quot;but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, &quot;In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">when out of the river there came up seven cows, fat and sleek, and they grazed among the reeds.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">After them, seven other cows came up--scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;In my dreams I also saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">After them, seven other heads sprouted--withered and thin and scorched by the east wind.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but none could explain it to me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, &quot;The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years; it is one and the same dream.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The seven lean, ugly cows that came up afterward are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind: They are seven years of famine.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will ravage the land.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The abundance in the land will not be remembered, because the famine that follows it will be so severe.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God, and God will do it soon.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, to be kept in the cities for food.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">This food should be held in reserve for the country, to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt, so that the country may not be ruined by the famine.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his officials.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So Pharaoh asked them, &quot;Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God ?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, &quot;Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one so discerning and wise as you.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people are to submit to your orders. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So Pharaoh said to Joseph, &quot;I hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Joseph&#x27;s finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He had him ride in a chariot as his second-in-command, and men shouted before him, &quot;Make way !&quot; Thus he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, &quot;I am Pharaoh, but without your word no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife. And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh&#x27;s presence and traveled throughout Egypt.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">During the seven years of abundance the land produced plentifully.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and stored it in the cities. In each city he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea; it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh and said, &quot;It is because God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father&#x27;s household.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The second son he named Ephraim and said, &quot;It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all the other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When all Egypt began to feel the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians, &quot;Go to Joseph and do what he tells you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When the famine had spread over the whole country, Joseph opened the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout Egypt.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And all the countries came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe in all the world.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute
