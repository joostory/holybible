Then Pharaoh woke up.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">He fell asleep again and had a second dream: Seven heads of grain, healthy and good, were growing on a single stalk.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted--thin and scorched by the east wind.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy, full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up; it had been a dream.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">In the morning his mind was troubled, so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, &quot;Today I am reminded of my shortcomings.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">Each of us had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard.

I told this to the magicians, but none could explain it to me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, &quot;The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same.

And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
