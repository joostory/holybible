him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He instructed them: &quot;This is what you are to say to my master Esau: &#x27;Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">I have

Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, &quot;We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups, and the flocks and herds and camels as well.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He thought, &quot;If Esau comes and attacks one group, the group that is left may escape.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Jacob prayed, &quot;O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who said to me, &#x27;Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two groups.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But you have said, &#x27;I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau:</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, &quot;Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He instructed the one in the lead: &quot;When my brother Esau meets you and asks, &#x27;To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">then you are to say, &#x27;They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: &quot;You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And be sure to say, &#x27;Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.&#x27; &quot; For he thought, &quot;I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So Jacob&#x27;s gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two maidservants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob&#x27;s hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then the man said, &quot;Let me go, for it is daybreak.&quot; But Jacob replied, &quot;I will not let you go unless you bless me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The man asked him, &quot;What is your name?&quot; &quot;Jacob,&quot; he answered.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then the man said, &quot;Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men and have overcome.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Jacob said, &quot;Please tell me your name.&quot; But he replied, &quot;Why do you ask my name?&quot; Then he blessed him there.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, &quot;It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob&#x27;s hip was touched near the tendon.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4 text-base gap-y-2 w-full"><li
