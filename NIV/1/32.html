later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me.&quot;</li><li>So Jacob&#x27;s gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.</li><li>That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two maidservants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.</li><li>After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions.</li><li>So Jacob was left

the man.</li><li>Then the man said, &quot;Let me go, for it is daybreak.&quot; But Jacob replied, &quot;I will not let you go unless you bless me.&quot;</li><li>The man asked him, &quot;What is your name?&quot; &quot;Jacob,&quot; he answered.</li><li>Then the man said, &quot;Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men and have overcome.&quot;</li><li>Jacob said, &quot;Please tell me your name.&quot; But he replied, &quot;Why do you ask my name?&quot; Then he blessed him there.</li><li>So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, &quot;It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.&quot;</li><li>The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip.</li><li>Therefore to
