We even saw the Anakites there.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Then I said to you, &quot;Do not be terrified; do not be afraid of them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">The LORD your God, who is going before you, will fight for you, as he did for you in Egypt, before your very eyes,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">and in the desert. There you saw how the LORD your God carried you, as a father carries his son, all the way you went until you reached this place.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">In spite of this, you did not trust in the LORD your God,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">who went ahead of you on your journey, in fire by night and in a cloud by day, to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should go.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">When the LORD heard what you said, he was angry and solemnly swore:</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">&quot;Not a man of this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your forefathers,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on, because he followed the LORD wholeheartedly.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Because of you the LORD became angry with me also and said, &quot;You shall not enter it, either.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">But your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will enter it. Encourage him, because he will lead Israel to inherit it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">And the little ones that you said would be taken captive, your children who do not yet know good from bad--they will enter the land. I will give it to them and they will take possession of it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">But as for you, turn around and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea. &quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Then you replied, &quot;We have sinned against the LORD. We will go up and fight, as the LORD our God commanded us.&quot; So every one of you put on his weapons, thinking it easy to go up into the hill country.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">But the LORD said to me, &quot;Tell them, &#x27;Do not go up and fight, because I will not be with you. You will be defeated by your enemies.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">So I told you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against the LORD&#x27;s command and in your arrogance you marched up into the hill country.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">The Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you; they chased you like a swarm of bees and beat you down from Seir all the way to Hormah.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">You came back and wept before the LORD, but he paid no attention to your weeping and turned a deaf ear to you.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">And so you stayed in Kadesh many days--all the time you spent there.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60
