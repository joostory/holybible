They will be afraid of you, but be very careful.</li><li>Do not provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, not even enough to put your foot on. I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his own.</li><li>You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.&#x27; &quot;</li><li>The LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this vast desert.

We turned from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber, and traveled along the desert road of Moab.</li><li>Then the LORD said to me, &quot;Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any part of their land. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession.&quot;</li><li>(The Emites used to live there--a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites.</li><li>Like the Anakites, they too were considered Rephaites, but the Moabites called them Emites.</li><li>Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out. They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did in the land the LORD gave them as their possession.)</li><li>And the LORD said, &quot;Now get up and cross the Zered Valley.&quot; So we crossed the valley.</li><li>Thirty-eight years passed from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley.

We left no survivors.</li><li>But the livestock and the plunder from the towns we had captured we carried off for ourselves.</li><li>From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the gorge, even as far as Gilead, not one town was too strong for us.
