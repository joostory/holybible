He will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you.</li><li>The LORD will bring a nation against you from far away, from the ends of the earth, like an eagle swooping down, a nation whose language you will not understand,</li><li>a fierce-looking nation without respect for the old or pity for the young.</li><li>They will devour the young of your livestock and the crops of your land until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain, new wine or oil, nor any calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks until you are ruined.</li><li>They will lay siege to all the cities throughout your land until the high fortified walls in which you trust fall down. They will besiege all the cities throughout the land the LORD your God is giving you.</li><li>Because of the suffering that your enemy will inflict on you during the siege, you will eat the fruit of the womb, the flesh of the sons and daughters the LORD your God has given you.</li><li>Even the most gentle and sensitive man among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his surviving children,</li><li>and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating. It will be all he has left because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege of all your cities.</li><li>The most gentle and sensitive woman among you--so sensitive and gentle that she would not venture to touch the ground with the sole of her foot--will begrudge the husband she loves and her own son or daughter</li><li>the afterbirth from her womb and the children she bears. For she intends to eat them secretly during the siege and in the distress that your enemy will inflict on you in your cities.</li><li>If you do not carefully follow all the words of this law, which are written in this book, and do not revere this glorious and awesome name--the LORD your God-</li><li>the LORD will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants, harsh and prolonged disasters, and severe and lingering illnesses.</li><li>He will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded, and they will cling to you.</li><li>The LORD will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this Book of the Law, until you are destroyed.</li><li>You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but few in number, because you did not obey the LORD your God.</li><li>Just as it pleased the LORD to make you prosper and increase in number, so it will please him to ruin and destroy you. You will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess.</li><li>Then the LORD will scatter you among all nations, from one end of the earth to the other. There you will worship other gods--gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known.</li><li>Among those nations you will find no repose, no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the LORD will give you an anxious mind, eyes weary with longing, and a despairing heart.</li><li>You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life.</li><li>In the morning you will say, &quot;If only it were evening!&quot; and in the evening, &quot;If only it were morning!&quot;-because of the terror that will fill your hearts and the sights that your eyes will see.</li><li>The LORD will send you back in ships to Egypt on a journey I said you should never make again. There you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4"><li><a href="/NIV">&lt;</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/1">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/2">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->2</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/3">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->3</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/4">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->4</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/5">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->5</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/6">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->6</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/7">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->7</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/8">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->8</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/9">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->9</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/10">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->10</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/11">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->11</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/12">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->12</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/13">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->13</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/14">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->14</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/15">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->15</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/16">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->16</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/17">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->17</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/18">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->18</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/19">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->19</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/20">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->20</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/21">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->21</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/22">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->22</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/23">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->23</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/24">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->24</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/25">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->25</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/26">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->26</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/27">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->27</a></li><li><a class="active" href="/NIV/5/28">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->28</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/29">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->29</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/30">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->30</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/31">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->31</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/32">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->32</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/33">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->33</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/5/34">Deuteronomy<!-- --> <!-- -->34</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"version":{"name":"NIV","vcode":"NIV"},"bible":{"bcode":5,"chapterCount":34,"name":"Deuteronomy","type":"old","vcode":"NIV"},"chapter":"28","verses":[{"bcode":5,"cnum":28,"content":"If you fully obey the LORD your God and carefully follow all his commands I give you today, the LORD your God will set you high above all the nations on earth.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":1},{"bcode":5,"cnum":28,"content":"All these blessings will come upon you and accompany you if you obey the LORD your God:","vcode":"NIV","vnum":2},{"bcode":5,"cnum":28,"content":"You will be blessed in the city and blessed in the country.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":3},{"bcode":5,"cnum":28,"content":"The fruit of your womb will be blessed, and the crops of your land and the young of your livestock--the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":4},{"bcode":5,"cnum":28,"content":"Your basket and your kneading trough will be blessed.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":5},{"bcode":5,"cnum":28,"content":"You will be blessed when you come in and blessed when you go out.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":6},{"bcode":5,"cnum":28,"content":"The LORD will grant that the enemies who rise up against you will be defeated before you.
