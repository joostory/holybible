Why this fierce, burning anger?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And the answer will be: &quot;It is because this people abandoned the covenant of the LORD, the God of their fathers, the covenant he made with them when he brought them out of Egypt.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They went off and worshiped other gods and bowed down to them, gods they did not know, gods he had not given them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Therefore the LORD&#x27;s anger burned against this land, so that he brought on it all the curses written in this book.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In furious anger and in great wrath the LORD uprooted them from their land and thrust them into another land, as it is now.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of this law.</li></ol></div></div><div
