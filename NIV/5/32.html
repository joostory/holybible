Oh, praise the greatness of our God!</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">He is the Rock, his works are perfect, and all his ways are just. A faithful God who does no wrong, upright and just is he.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">They have acted corruptly toward him; to their shame they are no longer his children, but a warped and crooked generation.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Is this the way you repay the LORD, O foolish and unwise people? Is he not your Father, your Creator, who made you and formed you?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Remember the days of old; consider the generations long past. Ask your father and he will tell you, your elders, and they will explain to you.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, when he divided all mankind, he set up boundaries for the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">For the LORD&#x27;s portion is his people, Jacob his allotted inheritance.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">In a desert land he found him, in a barren and howling waste. He shielded him and cared for him; he guarded him as the apple of his eye,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">like an eagle that stirs up its nest and hovers over its young, that spreads its wings to catch them and carries them on its pinions.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">The LORD alone led him; no foreign god was with him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">He made him ride on the heights of the land and fed him with the fruit of the fields.

Young men and young women will perish, infants and gray-haired men.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">I said I would scatter them and blot out their memory from mankind,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">but I dreaded the taunt of the enemy, lest the adversary misunderstand and say, &#x27;Our hand has triumphed; the LORD has not done all this.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">They are a nation without sense, there is no discernment in them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">If only they were wise and would understand this and discern what their end will be!</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">How could one man chase a thousand, or two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, unless the LORD had given them up?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">For their rock is not like our Rock, as even our enemies concede.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Their vine comes from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are filled with poison, and their clusters with bitterness.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Their wine is the venom of serpents, the deadly poison of cobras.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;Have I not kept this in reserve and sealed it in my vaults?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">It is mine to avenge; I will repay. In due time their foot will slip; their day of disaster is near and their doom rushes upon them.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">The LORD will judge his people and have compassion on his servants when he sees their strength is gone and no one is left, slave or free.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">He will say: &quot;Now where are their gods, the rock they took refuge in,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">the gods who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings?

I put to death and I bring to life, I have wounded and I will heal, and no one can deliver out of my hand.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">I lift my hand to heaven and declare: As surely as I live forever,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">when I sharpen my flashing sword and my hand grasps it in judgment, I will take vengeance on my adversaries and repay those who hate me.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">I will make my arrows drunk with blood, while my sword devours flesh: the blood of the slain and the captives, the heads of the enemy leaders.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Rejoice, O nations, with his people, , for he will avenge the blood of his servants; he will take vengeance on his enemies and make atonement for his land and people.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Moses came with Joshua son of Nun and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">When Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">he said to them, &quot;Take to heart all the words I have solemnly declared to you this day, so that you may command your children to obey carefully all the words of this law.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">They are not just idle words for you--they are your life. By them you will live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">On that same day the LORD told Moses,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;Go up into the Abarim Range to Mount Nebo in Moab, across from Jericho, and view Canaan, the land I am giving the Israelites as their own possession.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">There on the mountain that you have climbed you will die and be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">This is because both of you broke faith with me in the presence of the Israelites at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the Desert of Zin and because you did not uphold my holiness among the Israelites.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1
