Their grapes are filled with poison, and their clusters with bitterness.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Their wine is the venom of serpents, the deadly poison of cobras.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Have I not kept this in reserve and sealed it in my vaults?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">It is mine to avenge; I will repay.

I put to death and I bring to life, I have wounded and I will heal, and no one can deliver out of my hand.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I lift my hand to heaven and declare: As surely as I live forever,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">when I sharpen my flashing sword and my hand grasps it in judgment, I will take vengeance on my adversaries and repay those who hate me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I will make my arrows drunk with blood, while my sword devours flesh: the blood of the slain and the captives, the heads of the enemy leaders.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Rejoice, O nations, with his people, , for he will avenge the blood of his servants; he will take vengeance on his enemies and make atonement for his land and people.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Moses came with Joshua son of Nun and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">he said to them, &quot;Take to heart all the words I have solemnly declared to you this day, so that you may command your children to obey carefully all the words of this law.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They are not just idle words for you--they are your life. By them you will live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">On that same day the LORD told Moses,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Go up into the Abarim Range to Mount Nebo in Moab, across from Jericho, and view Canaan, the land I am giving

people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">This is because both of you broke
