Their grapes are filled with poison, and their clusters with bitterness.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Their wine is the venom of serpents, the deadly poison of cobras.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Have I not kept this in reserve and sealed it in my vaults?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">It is mine to avenge; I will repay.

I put to death and I bring to life, I have wounded and I will heal, and no one can deliver out of my hand.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I lift my hand to heaven and declare: As surely as I live forever,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">when I sharpen my flashing sword and my hand grasps it in judgment, I will take vengeance on my adversaries and repay those who hate me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I will make my arrows drunk with blood, while my sword devours flesh: the blood of the slain and the captives, the heads of the enemy leaders.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Rejoice, O nations, with his people, , for he will avenge the blood of his servants; he will take vengeance on his enemies and make atonement for his land and people.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Moses came with Joshua son of Nun and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">he said to them, &quot;Take to heart all the words I have solemnly declared to you this day, so that you may command your children to obey carefully all the words of this law.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They are not just idle words for you--they are your life. By them you will live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">On that same day the LORD told Moses,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Go up into the Abarim Range to Mount Nebo in Moab, across from Jericho, and view Canaan, the land I am giving the Israelites as their own possession.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">There on the mountain that you have climbed you will die and be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">This is because both of you broke
