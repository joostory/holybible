land, and the people of the land choose one of their men and make him their watchman,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and he sees the sword coming against the land and blows the trumpet to warn the people,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">then if anyone hears the trumpet but does not take warning and the

How then can we live?&quot; &#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Say to them, &#x27;As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, O house of Israel?&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Therefore, son of man, say to your countrymen, &#x27;The righteousness of the righteous man will not save him when he disobeys, and the wickedness of the wicked man will not cause him to fall when he turns from it.
