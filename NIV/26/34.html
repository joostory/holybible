the LORD came to me:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy and say to them: &#x27;This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Woe to the shepherds of Israel who only take care of themselves! Should not shepherds take care of the flock?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You eat the curds, clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals, but you do not take care of the flock.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured. You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost. You have ruled them harshly and brutally.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So they were scattered because there was no shepherd, and when they were scattered they became food for all the wild animals.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. They were scattered over the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot; &#x27;Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD :</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, because my flock lacks a shepherd and so has been plundered and has become food for all the wild animals, and because my shepherds did not search for my flock but cared for themselves rather than for my flock,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">therefore, O shepherds, hear the word of the LORD :</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against the shepherds and will hold them accountable for my flock. I will remove them from tending the flock so that the shepherds can no longer feed themselves. I will rescue my flock from their mouths, and it will no longer be food for them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot; &#x27;For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I myself will search for my sheep and look after them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them, so will I look after my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I will bring them out from the nations and gather them from the countries, and I will bring them into their own land. I will pasture them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines and in all the settlements in the land.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I will tend them in a good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel will be their grazing land.

I will judge between one sheep and another.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I will place over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he will tend them; he will tend them and be their shepherd.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David will be prince among them. I the LORD have spoken.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot; &#x27;I will make a covenant of peace with them and rid the land of wild beasts so that they may live in the desert and sleep in the forests in safety.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I will bless them and the places surrounding my hill. I will send down showers in season; there will be showers of blessing.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The trees of the field will yield their fruit and the ground will yield its crops; the people will be secure in their land. They will know that I am the LORD, when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the hands of those who enslaved them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They will no longer be plundered by the nations, nor will wild animals devour them. They will live in safety, and no one will make them afraid.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I will provide for them a land renowned for its crops, and they will no longer be victims of famine in the land or bear the scorn of the nations.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then they will know that I, the
