It has roused itself against you. It has come!</li><li>Doom has come upon you--you who dwell in the land. The time has come, the day is near; there is panic, not joy, upon the mountains.</li><li>I am about to pour out my wrath on you and spend my anger against you; I will judge you according to your conduct and repay you for all your detestable practices.</li><li>I will not look on you with pity or spare you; I will repay you in accordance with your conduct and the detestable practices among you.
