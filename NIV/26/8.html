year, in the sixth month on the fifth day, while I was sitting in my house and the elders of Judah were sitting before me, the hand of the Sovereign LORD came upon me there.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I looked, and I saw a figure like that of a man. From what appeared to be his waist down he was like fire, and from there up his appearance was as bright as glowing metal.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He stretched out what looked like a hand and took me by the hair of my head. The Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and in visions of God he took me to Jerusalem, to the entrance to the north gate of the inner court, where the idol that provokes to jealousy stood.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And there before me was the glory of the God of Israel, as in the vision I had seen in the plain.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he said to me, &quot;Son of man, look toward the north.&quot; So I looked, and in the entrance north of the gate of the altar I saw this idol of jealousy.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And he said to me, &quot;Son of man, do you see what they are doing--the utterly detestable things the house of Israel is doing here, things that will drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see things that are even more detestable.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he brought me to the entrance to the court. I looked, and I saw a hole in the wall.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He said to me, &quot;Son of man, now dig into the wall.&quot; So I dug into the wall and saw a doorway there.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And he said to me, &quot;Go in and see the wicked and detestable things they are doing here.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So I went in and looked, and I saw portrayed all over the walls all kinds of crawling things and detestable animals and all the idols of the house of Israel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In front of them stood seventy elders of the house of Israel, and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan was standing among them. Each had a censer in his hand, and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He said to me, &quot;Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness, each at the shrine of his own idol?

You will see things that are even more detestable than this.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He then brought me into the inner court of the house of the LORD, and there at the entrance to the temple, between the portico and the altar, were about twenty-five men. With their backs toward the temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east, they were bowing down to the sun in the east.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He said to me, &quot;Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a trivial matter for the house of Judah to do the detestable things they are doing here? Must they also fill the land with violence and continually provoke me to anger? Look at them putting the branch to their nose!</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Therefore I will deal with them in anger; I will not look on them with pity or spare them.
