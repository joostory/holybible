with you in majesty?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Consider Assyria, once a cedar in Lebanon, with beautiful branches overshadowing the forest; it towered on high, its top above the thick foliage.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The waters nourished it, deep springs made it grow tall; their streams flowed all around its base and sent their channels to all the trees of the field.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So it towered higher than all the trees of the field; its boughs increased and its branches grew long, spreading because of abundant waters.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">All the birds of the air nested in its boughs, all the beasts of the field gave birth under its branches; all the great nations lived in its shade.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">It was majestic in beauty, with its spreading boughs, for its roots went down to abundant waters.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The cedars in the garden of God could not rival it, nor could the pine trees equal its boughs, nor could the plane trees compare with its branches-- no tree in the garden of God could match its beauty.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">I made it beautiful with abundant branches, the envy of all the trees of Eden in the garden of God.</li><li

its wickedness. I cast it aside,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">and the most ruthless of foreign nations cut it down and left it.

All the nations of the earth came out from under its shade and left it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">All the birds of the air settled on the fallen tree, and all the beasts of the field were among its branches.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Therefore no other trees by the waters are ever to tower proudly on high, lifting their tops above the thick foliage. No other trees so well-watered are ever to reach such a height; they are all destined for death, for the earth below, among mortal men, with those who go down to the pit.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot; &#x27;This is what the Sovereign LORD says: On the day it was brought down to the grave I covered the deep springs with mourning for it; I held back its streams, and its abundant waters were restrained. Because of it I clothed Lebanon with gloom, and all the trees of the field withered away.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">I made the nations tremble at the sound of its fall when I brought it down to the grave with those who go down to the pit.

Yet you, too, will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the earth below; you will lie among the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword. &quot; &#x27;This is Pharaoh and all his hordes,
