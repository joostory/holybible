the Mount of Olives.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and said to Jesus, &quot;Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, &quot;If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus straightened up and asked her, &quot;Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;No one, sir,&quot; she said. &quot;Then neither do I condemn you,&quot; Jesus declared. &quot;Go now and leave your life of sin.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, &quot;I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Pharisees challenged him, &quot;Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus answered, &quot;Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But if I do judge, my decisions are right, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then they asked him, &quot;Where is your father?&quot; &quot;You do not know me or my Father,&quot; Jesus replied. &quot;If you knew me, you would know my Father also.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He spoke these words while teaching in the temple area near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his time had not yet come.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Once more Jesus said to them, &quot;I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">This made the Jews ask, &quot;Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, &#x27;Where I go, you cannot come&#x27;?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But he continued, &quot;You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am the one I claim to be, you will indeed die in your sins.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Who are you?&quot; they asked. &quot;Just what I have been claiming all along,&quot; Jesus replied.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is reliable, and what I have heard from him I tell the world.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Jesus said, &quot;When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am the one I claim to be and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Even as he spoke, many put their faith in him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, &quot;If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They answered him, &quot;We are Abraham&#x27;s descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus replied, &quot;I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I know you are Abraham&#x27;s descendants. Yet you are ready to kill me, because you have no room for my word.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I am telling you what I have seen in the Father&#x27;s presence, and you do what you have heard from your father.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Abraham is our father,&quot; they answered. &quot;If you were Abraham&#x27;s children,&quot; said Jesus, &quot;then you would do the things Abraham did.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As it is, you are determined to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You are doing the things your own father does.&quot; &quot;We are not illegitimate children,&quot; they protested. &quot;The only Father we have is God himself.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus said to them, &quot;If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and now am here. I have not come on my own; but he sent me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father&#x27;s desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don&#x27;t you believe me?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He who belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Jews answered him, &quot;Aren&#x27;t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;I am not possessed by a demon,&quot; said Jesus, &quot;but I honor my Father and you dishonor me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I tell you the truth, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At this the Jews exclaimed, &quot;Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that if anyone keeps your word, he will never taste death.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus replied, &quot;If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and keep his word.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;You are not yet fifty years old,&quot; the Jews said to him, &quot;and you have seen Abraham!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;I tell you the truth,&quot; Jesus answered, &quot;before Abraham was born, I am!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4 text-base gap-y-2
