As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">The Jews insisted, &quot;We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">and he went back inside the palace. &quot;Where do you come from?&quot; he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">&quot;Do you refuse to speak to me?&quot; Pilate said. &quot;Don&#x27;t you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Jesus answered, &quot;You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above.

So the soldiers took charge of Jesus.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha).</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Here they crucified him, and with him two others--one on each side and Jesus in the middle.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross.

Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus&#x27; side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: &quot;Not one of his bones will be broken,&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">and, as another scripture says, &quot;They will look on the one they have pierced.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus.
