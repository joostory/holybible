Jesus and had him flogged.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and went up to him again and again, saying, &quot;Hail, king of the Jews!&quot; And they struck him in the face.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews, &quot;Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, &quot;Here is the man!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, &quot;Crucify! Crucify!&quot; But Pilate answered, &quot;You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Jews insisted, &quot;We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and he went back inside the palace. &quot;Where do you come from?&quot; he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Do you refuse to speak to me?&quot; Pilate said. &quot;Don&#x27;t you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus answered, &quot;You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jews kept shouting, &quot;If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge&#x27;s seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha).</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">It was the day of Preparation of Passover Week, about the sixth hour. &quot;Here is your king,&quot; Pilate said to the Jews.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But they shouted, &quot;Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!&quot; &quot;Shall I crucify your king?&quot; Pilate asked. &quot;We have no king but Caesar,&quot; the chief priests answered.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. So the soldiers took charge of Jesus.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha).</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Here they crucified him, and with him two others--one on each side and Jesus in the middle.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read:|sc JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, &quot;Do not write &#x27;The King of the Jews,&#x27; but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Pilate answered, &quot;What I have written, I have written.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Let&#x27;s not tear it,&quot; they said to one another. &quot;Let&#x27;s decide by lot who will get it.&quot; This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled which said, &quot;They divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.&quot; So this is what the soldiers did.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother&#x27;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, &quot;Dear woman, here is your son,&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and to the disciple, &quot;Here is your mother.&quot; From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Later, knowing that all was now completed, and so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, &quot;I am thirsty.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus&#x27; lips.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he had received the drink, Jesus said, &quot;It is finished.&quot; With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus&#x27; side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: &quot;Not one of his bones will be broken,&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and, as another scripture says, &quot;They will look on the one they have pierced.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jews. With Pilate&#x27;s permission, he came and took the body away.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Taking Jesus&#x27; body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4
