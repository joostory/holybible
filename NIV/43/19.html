As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.&quot;</li><li>The Jews insisted, &quot;We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.&quot;</li><li>When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid,</li><li>and he went back inside the palace. &quot;Where do you come from?&quot; he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer.</li><li>&quot;Do you refuse to speak to me?&quot; Pilate said. &quot;Don&#x27;t you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?&quot;</li><li>Jesus answered, &quot;You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.&quot;</li><li>From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jews kept shouting, &quot;If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar.&quot;</li><li>When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge&#x27;s seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha).</li><li>It was the day of Preparation of Passover Week, about the sixth hour. &quot;Here is your king,&quot; Pilate said to the Jews.</li><li>But they shouted, &quot;Take him away! Take him away!

Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down.</li><li>The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other.</li><li>But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</li><li>Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus&#x27; side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water.</li><li>The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true.

Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jews.
