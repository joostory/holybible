As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The Jews insisted, &quot;We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">and he went back inside the palace. &quot;Where do you come from?&quot; he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;Do you refuse to speak to me?&quot; Pilate said. &quot;Don&#x27;t you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Jesus answered, &quot;You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above.

So the soldiers took charge of Jesus.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha).</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Here they crucified him, and with him two others--one on each side and Jesus in the middle.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read:|sc JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, &quot;Do not write &#x27;The King of the Jews,&#x27; but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Pilate answered, &quot;What I have written, I have written.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining.

Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus&#x27; side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: &quot;Not one of his bones will be broken,&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">and, as another scripture says, &quot;They will look on the one they have pierced.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jews. With Pilate&#x27;s permission, he came and took the body away.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Taking Jesus&#x27; body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4 text-base gap-y-2 w-full"><li class="__className_872c54"><a href="/NIV"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-5 w-5"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.75 19.5 8.25 12l7.5-7.5"></path></svg></a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/1">John<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/2">John<!-- --> <!-- -->2</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/3">John<!-- --> <!-- -->3</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/4">John<!-- --> <!-- -->4</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/5">John<!-- --> <!-- -->5</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/6">John<!-- --> <!-- -->6</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/7">John<!-- --> <!-- -->7</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/8">John<!-- --> <!-- -->8</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/9">John<!-- --> <!-- -->9</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/10">John<!-- --> <!-- -->10</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/11">John<!-- --> <!-- -->11</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/12">John<!-- --> <!-- -->12</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/13">John<!-- --> <!-- -->13</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/14">John<!-- --> <!-- -->14</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/15">John<!-- --> <!-- -->15</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/16">John<!-- --> <!-- -->16</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/17">John<!-- --> <!-- -->17</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/18">John<!-- --> <!-- -->18</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="menu-active" href="/NIV/43/19">John<!-- --> <!-- -->19</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/20">John<!-- --> <!-- -->20</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/21">John<!-- --> <!-- -->21</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"version":{"name":"NIV","vcode":"NIV"},"bible":{"bcode":43,"chapterCount":21,"name":"John","type":"new","vcode":"NIV"},"chapter":"19","verses":[{"bcode":43,"cnum":19,"content":"Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":1},{"bcode":43,"cnum":19,"content":"The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head.
