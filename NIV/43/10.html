the truth, the man who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The man who enters by the gate is the shepherd of his sheep.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The watchman opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger&#x27;s voice.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus used this figure of speech, but they did not understand what he was telling them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Therefore Jesus said again, &quot;I tell you the truth, I am the gate for the sheep.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">All who ever came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. He will come in and go out, and find pasture.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;I am the good shepherd.

I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again.

Why listen to him?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But others said, &quot;These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and Jesus was in the temple area walking in Solomon&#x27;s Colonnade.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Jews gathered around him, saying, &quot;How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus answered, &quot;I did tell you, but you do not believe.

For which of these do you stone me?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;We are not stoning you for any of these,&quot; replied the Jews, &quot;but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus answered them, &quot;Is it not written in your Law, &#x27;I have said you are gods&#x27;?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If he called them &#x27;gods,&#x27; to whom the word of God came--and the Scripture cannot be broken--</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, &#x27;I am God&#x27;s Son&#x27;?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Do not believe me unless I do what my Father does.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But if I do it, even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped their grasp.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing in the early days. Here he stayed</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and many people came to him. They said, &quot;Though John never performed a miraculous sign, all that John said about this man was true.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And in
