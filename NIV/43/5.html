Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Here a great number of disabled people used to lie--the blind, the lame, the paralyzed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677"></li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, &quot;Do you want to get well?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Sir,&quot; the invalid replied, &quot;I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Jesus said to him, &quot;Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, &quot;It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But he replied, &quot;The man who made me well said to me, &#x27;Pick up your mat and walk.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So they asked him, &quot;Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, &quot;See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews persecuted him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus said to them, &quot;My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus gave them this answer: &quot;I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and come out--those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is valid.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the very work that the Father has given me to finish, and which I am doing, testifies that the Father has sent me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about me,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">yet you refuse to come to me to have life.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;I do not accept praise from men,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I have come in my Father&#x27;s name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">How can you believe if you accept praise from one another, yet make no effort to obtain the praise that comes from the only God?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?&quot;</li></ol></div></div><div
