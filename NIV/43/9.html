he saw a man blind from birth.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">His disciples asked him, &quot;Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Neither this man nor his parents sinned,&quot; said Jesus, &quot;but this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As long as it is day, we must do the work of him who sent me.

So the man went and washed, and came home seeing.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, &quot;Isn&#x27;t this the same man who used to sit and beg?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Some claimed that he was. Others said, &quot;No, he only looks like him.&quot; But he himself insisted, &quot;I am the man.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;How then were your eyes opened?&quot; they demanded.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He replied, &quot;The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Where is this man?&quot; they asked him. &quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; he said.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man&#x27;s eyes was a Sabbath.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. &quot;He put mud on my eyes,&quot; the man replied, &quot;and I washed, and now I see.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Some of the Pharisees said, &quot;This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.&quot; But others asked, &quot;How can a sinner do such miraculous signs?&quot; So they were divided.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Finally they turned again to the blind man, &quot;What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened.&quot; The man replied, &quot;He is a prophet.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Jews still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man&#x27;s parents.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Is this your son?&quot; they asked. &quot;Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;We know he is our son,&quot; the parents answered, &quot;and we know he was born blind.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don&#x27;t know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for already the Jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ would be put out of the synagogue.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">That was why his parents said, &quot;He is of age; ask him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. &quot;Give glory to God,&quot; they said. &quot;We know this man is a sinner.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He replied, &quot;Whether he is a sinner or not, I don&#x27;t know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then they asked him, &quot;What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He answered, &quot;I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then they hurled insults at him and said, &quot;You are this fellow&#x27;s disciple! We are disciples of Moses!</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don&#x27;t even know where he comes from.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The man answered, &quot;Now that is remarkable! You don&#x27;t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly man who does his will.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">To this they replied, &quot;You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!&quot; And they threw him out.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, &quot;Do you believe in the Son of Man?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Who is he, sir?&quot; the man asked. &quot;Tell me so that I may believe in him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus said, &quot;You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the man said, &quot;Lord, I believe,&quot; and he worshiped him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus said, &quot;For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, &quot;What? Are we blind too?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus said, &quot;If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you
