Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Jesus said, &quot;I am with you for only a short time, and then I go to the one who sent me.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">The Jews said to one another, &quot;Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him?

Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">On hearing his words, some of the people said, &quot;Surely this man is the Prophet.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Others said, &quot;He is the Christ.&quot; Still others asked, &quot;How can the Christ come from Galilee?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Does not the Scripture say that the Christ will come from David&#x27;s family and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Thus the people were divided because of Jesus.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you bring him in?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">&quot;No one ever spoke the way this man does,&quot; the guards declared.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">&quot;You mean he has deceived you also?&quot; the Pharisees retorted.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">&quot;Has any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">No! But this mob that knows nothing of the law--there is a curse on them.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">&quot;Does our law condemn anyone without first hearing him to find out what he is doing?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">They replied, &quot;Are you from Galilee, too?
