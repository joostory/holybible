Some said, &quot;He is a good man.&quot; Others replied, &quot;No, he deceives the people.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">But no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the Jews.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Not until halfway through the Feast did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The Jews were amazed and asked, &quot;How did this man get such learning without having studied?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Jesus answered, &quot;My teaching is not my own.

Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">On hearing his words, some of the people said, &quot;Surely this man is the Prophet.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Others said, &quot;He is the Christ.&quot; Still others asked, &quot;How can the Christ come from Galilee?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Does not the Scripture say that the Christ will come from David&#x27;s family and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Thus the people were divided because of Jesus.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you bring him in?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;No one ever spoke the way this man does,&quot; the guards declared.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;You mean he has deceived you also?&quot; the Pharisees retorted.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;Has any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">No! But this mob that knows nothing of the law--there is a curse on them.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;Does our law condemn anyone without first hearing him to find out what he is doing?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">They replied, &quot;Are you from Galilee, too?
