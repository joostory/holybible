Are you Elijah?&quot; He said, &quot;I am not.&quot; &quot;Are you the Prophet?&quot; He answered, &quot;No.&quot;</li><li>Finally they said, &quot;Who are you?

Jesus looked at him and said, &quot;You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas&quot; (which, when translated, is Peter).</li><li>The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee.

Jesus answered, &quot;I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.&quot;</li><li>Then Nathanael declared, &quot;Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.&quot;</li><li>Jesus said, &quot;You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree.
