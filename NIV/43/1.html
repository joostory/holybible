leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In him was life, and that life was the light of men.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2

that gives light to every man was coming into the world.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God--</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2

We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, &quot;This was he of whom I said, &#x27;He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only,who is at the Father&#x27;s side, has made him known.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now this was John&#x27;s testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, &quot;I am not the Christ.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They asked him, &quot;Then who are you? Are you Elijah?&quot; He said, &quot;I am not.&quot; &quot;Are you the Prophet?&quot; He answered, &quot;No.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Finally they said, &quot;Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, &quot;I am the voice of one calling in the desert, &#x27;Make straight the way for the Lord.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now some Pharisees who had been sent</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">questioned him, &quot;Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;I baptize with water,&quot; John replied, &quot;but among you stands one you do not know.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, &quot;Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">This is the one I meant when I said, &#x27;A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then John gave this testimony: &quot;I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, &#x27;The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, &quot;Look, the Lamb of God!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, &quot;What do you want?&quot; They said, &quot;Rabbi&quot; (which means Teacher), &quot;where are you staying?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Come,&quot; he replied, &quot;and you will see.&quot; So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Andrew, Simon Peter&#x27;s brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, &quot;We have found the Messiah&quot; (that is, the Christ).</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, &quot;You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas&quot; (which, when translated, is Peter).</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, &quot;Follow me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Philip found Nathanael and told him, &quot;We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?&quot; Nathanael asked. &quot;Come and see,&quot; said Philip.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, &quot;Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;How do you know me?&quot; Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, &quot;I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Nathanael declared, &quot;Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus said, &quot;You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He then added, &quot;I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&quot;</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200
