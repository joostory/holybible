Jesus answered, &quot;I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Nathanael declared, &quot;Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus said, &quot;You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He then added, &quot;I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven open, and
