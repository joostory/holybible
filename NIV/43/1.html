Are you Elijah?&quot; He said, &quot;I am not.&quot; &quot;Are you the Prophet?&quot; He answered, &quot;No.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Finally they said, &quot;Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, &quot;I am the voice of one calling in the desert, &#x27;Make straight the way for the Lord.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Now some Pharisees who had been sent</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">questioned him, &quot;Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;I baptize with water,&quot; John replied, &quot;but among you stands one you do not know.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, &quot;Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">This is the one I meant when I said, &#x27;A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then John gave this testimony: &quot;I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, &#x27;The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, &quot;Look, the Lamb of God!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, &quot;What do you want?&quot; They said, &quot;Rabbi&quot; (which means Teacher), &quot;where are you staying?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;Come,&quot; he replied, &quot;and you will see.&quot; So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Andrew, Simon Peter&#x27;s brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, &quot;We have found the Messiah&quot; (that is, the Christ).</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, &quot;You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas&quot; (which, when translated, is Peter).</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, &quot;Follow me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Philip found Nathanael and told him, &quot;We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?&quot; Nathanael asked. &quot;Come and see,&quot; said Philip.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, &quot;Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;How do you know me?&quot; Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, &quot;I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Nathanael declared, &quot;Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Jesus said, &quot;You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He then added, &quot;I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&quot;</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4 text-base gap-y-2"><li class="__className_872c54"><a href="/NIV"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-5 w-5"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.75 19.5 8.25 12l7.5-7.5"></path></svg></a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="active" href="/NIV/43/1">John<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/2">John<!-- --> <!-- -->2</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/3">John<!-- --> <!-- -->3</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/4">John<!-- --> <!-- -->4</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/5">John<!-- --> <!-- -->5</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/6">John<!-- --> <!-- -->6</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/7">John<!-- --> <!-- -->7</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/8">John<!-- --> <!-- -->8</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/9">John<!-- --> <!-- -->9</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/10">John<!-- --> <!-- -->10</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/11">John<!-- --> <!-- -->11</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/12">John<!-- --> <!-- -->12</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/13">John<!-- --> <!-- -->13</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/14">John<!-- --> <!-- -->14</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/15">John<!-- --> <!-- -->15</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/16">John<!-- --> <!-- -->16</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/17">John<!-- --> <!-- -->17</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/18">John<!-- --> <!-- -->18</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/19">John<!-- --> <!-- -->19</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/20">John<!-- --> <!-- -->20</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/21">John<!-- --> <!-- -->21</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"version":{"name":"NIV","vcode":"NIV"},"bible":{"bcode":43,"chapterCount":21,"name":"John","type":"new","vcode":"NIV"},"chapter":"1","verses":[{"bcode":43,"cnum":1,"content":"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":1},{"bcode":43,"cnum":1,"content":"He was with God in the beginning.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":2},{"bcode":43,"cnum":1,"content":"Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":3},{"bcode":43,"cnum":1,"content":"In him was life, and that life was the light of men.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":4},{"bcode":43,"cnum":1,"content":"The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":5},{"bcode":43,"cnum":1,"content":"There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":6},{"bcode":43,"cnum":1,"content":"He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":7},{"bcode":43,"cnum":1,"content":"He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":8},{"bcode":43,"cnum":1,"content":"The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":9},{"bcode":43,"cnum":1,"content":"He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":10},{"bcode":43,"cnum":1,"content":"He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":11},{"bcode":43,"cnum":1,"content":"Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God--","vcode":"NIV","vnum":12},{"bcode":43,"cnum":1,"content":"children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":13},{"bcode":43,"cnum":1,"content":"The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.
