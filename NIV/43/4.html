heard that Jesus was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the Lord learned of this, he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now he had to go through Samaria.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jacob&#x27;s well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, &quot;Will you give me a drink?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Samaritan woman said to him, &quot;You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?&quot; (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.)</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus answered her, &quot;If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Sir,&quot; the woman said, &quot;you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his flocks and herds?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus answered, &quot;Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The woman said to him, &quot;Sir, give me this water so that I won&#x27;t get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He told her, &quot;Go, call your husband and come back.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;I have no husband,&quot; she replied. Jesus said to her, &quot;You are right when you say you have no husband.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Sir,&quot; the woman said, &quot;I can see that you are a prophet.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus declared, &quot;Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The woman said, &quot;I know that Messiah&quot; (called Christ) &quot;is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Jesus declared, &quot;I who speak to you am he.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, &quot;What do you want?&quot; or &quot;Why are you talking with her?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They came out of the town and made their way toward him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Meanwhile his disciples urged him, &quot;Rabbi, eat something.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But he said to them, &quot;I have food to eat that you know nothing about.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then his disciples said to each other, &quot;Could someone have brought him food?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;My food,&quot; said Jesus, &quot;is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Do you not say, &#x27;Four months more and then the harvest&#x27;? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Even now the reaper draws his wages, even now he harvests the crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Thus the saying &#x27;One sows and another reaps&#x27; is true.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman&#x27;s testimony, &quot;He told me everything I ever did.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And because of his words many more became believers.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They said to the woman, &quot;We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">After the two days he left for Galilee.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">(Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.)</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, for they also had been there.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders,&quot; Jesus told him, &quot;you will never believe.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The royal official said, &quot;Sir, come down before my child dies.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus replied, &quot;You may go. Your son will live.&quot; The man took Jesus at his word and departed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, &quot;The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, &quot;Your son will live.&quot; So he and all his household believed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed, having come from Judea to Galilee.</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto
