appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Tiberias. It happened this way:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;I&#x27;m going out to fish,&quot; Simon Peter told them, and they said, &quot;We&#x27;ll go with you.&quot; So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He called out to them, &quot;Friends, haven&#x27;t you any fish?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; they answered.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He said, &quot;Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.&quot; When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, &quot;It is the Lord!&quot; As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, &quot;It is the Lord,&quot; he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus said to them, &quot;Bring some of the fish you have just caught.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus said to them, &quot;Come and have breakfast.&quot; None of the disciples dared ask him, &quot;Who are you?&quot; They knew it was the Lord.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, &quot;Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?&quot; &quot;Yes, Lord,&quot; he said, &quot;you know that I love you.&quot; Jesus said, &quot;Feed my lambs.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Again Jesus said, &quot;Simon son of John, do you truly love me?&quot; He answered, &quot;Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.&quot; Jesus said, &quot;Take care of my sheep.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The third time he said to him, &quot;Simon son of John, do you love me?&quot; Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, &quot;Do you love me?&quot; He said, &quot;Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus said, &quot;Feed my sheep. I tell you the truth, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, &quot;Follow me!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, &quot;Lord, who is going to betray you?&quot;)</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Peter saw him, he asked, &quot;Lord, what about him?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus answered, &quot;If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, &quot;If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.</li></ol></div><button class="absolute btn btn-soft btn-circle
