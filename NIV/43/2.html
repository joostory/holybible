wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus&#x27; mother was there,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the wine was gone, Jesus&#x27; mother said to him, &quot;They have no more wine.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Dear woman, why do you involve me?&quot; Jesus replied, &quot;My time has not yet come.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">His mother said to the servants, &quot;Do whatever he tells you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus said to the servants, &quot;Fill the jars with water&quot;; so they filled them to the brim.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he told them, &quot;Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.&quot; They did so,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and said, &quot;Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">This, the first of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee. He thus revealed his glory, and his disciples put their faith in him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In the temple courts he found men selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple area, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">To those who sold doves he said, &quot;Get these out of here! How dare you turn my Father&#x27;s house into a market!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">His disciples remembered that it is written: &quot;Zeal for your house will consume me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the Jews demanded of him, &quot;What miraculous sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus answered them, &quot;Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Jews replied, &quot;It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But the temple he had spoken of was his body.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the Scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many people saw the miraculous signs he was doing and believed in his name.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Jesus would not entrust himself to them,
