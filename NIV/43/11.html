No, it is for God&#x27;s glory so that God&#x27;s Son may be glorified through it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Yet when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he said to his disciples, &quot;Let us go back to Judea.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;But Rabbi,&quot; they said, &quot;a short while ago the Jews tried to stone you, and yet you are going back there?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus answered, &quot;Are there not twelve hours of daylight? A man who walks by day will not stumble, for he sees by this world&#x27;s light.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">It is when he walks by night that he stumbles, for he has no light.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">After he had said this, he went on to tell them, &quot;Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">His disciples replied, &quot;Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So then he told them plainly, &quot;Lazarus is dead,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Thomas (called Didymus) said to the rest of the disciples, &quot;Let us also go, that we may die with him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">On his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Lord,&quot; Martha said to Jesus, &quot;if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus said to her, &quot;Your brother will rise again.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Martha answered, &quot;I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus said to her, &quot;I am the resurrection and the life.

Do you believe this?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Yes, Lord,&quot; she told him, &quot;I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And after she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. &quot;The Teacher is here,&quot; she said, &quot;and is asking for you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, &quot;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Where have you laid him?&quot; he asked. &quot;Come and see, Lord,&quot; they replied.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus wept.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the Jews said, &quot;See how he loved him!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But some of them said, &quot;Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Take away the stone,&quot; he said. &quot;But, Lord,&quot; said Martha, the sister of the dead man, &quot;by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Jesus said, &quot;Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, &quot;Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, &quot;Lazarus, come out!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, &quot;Take off the grave clothes and let him go.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. &quot;What are we accomplishing?&quot; they asked. &quot;Here is this man performing many miraculous signs.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, &quot;You know nothing at all!</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So from that day on they plotted to take his life.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the Jews. Instead he withdrew to a region near the desert, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple area they asked one another, &quot;What do you think? Isn&#x27;t he coming to the Feast at all?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone found out where Jesus was, he should report it so that they might arrest him.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200
