Do you believe this?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;Yes, Lord,&quot; she told him, &quot;I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">And after she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. &quot;The Teacher is here,&quot; she said, &quot;and is asking for you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, &quot;Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;Where have you laid him?&quot; he asked. &quot;Come and see, Lord,&quot; they replied.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Jesus wept.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then the Jews said, &quot;See how he loved him!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">But some of them said, &quot;Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb.

Then Jesus looked up and said, &quot;Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, &quot;Lazarus, come out!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, &quot;Take off the grave clothes and let him go.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. &quot;What are we accomplishing?&quot; they asked. &quot;Here is this man performing many miraculous signs.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, &quot;You know nothing at all!</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">So from that day on they plotted to take his life.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the Jews. Instead he withdrew to a region near the desert, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple area they asked one another, &quot;What do you think? Isn&#x27;t he coming to the Feast at all?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone found out where Jesus was, he should report it so that they might arrest him.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4"><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a href="/NIV"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" class="h-5 w-5"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.75 19.5L8.25 12l7.5-7.5"></path></svg></a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/1">John<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/2">John<!-- --> <!-- -->2</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/3">John<!-- --> <!-- -->3</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/4">John<!-- --> <!-- -->4</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/5">John<!-- --> <!-- -->5</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/6">John<!-- --> <!-- -->6</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/7">John<!-- --> <!-- -->7</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/8">John<!-- --> <!-- -->8</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/9">John<!-- --> <!-- -->9</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/10">John<!-- --> <!-- -->10</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="active" href="/NIV/43/11">John<!-- --> <!-- -->11</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/12">John<!-- --> <!-- -->12</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/13">John<!-- --> <!-- -->13</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/14">John<!-- --> <!-- -->14</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/15">John<!-- --> <!-- -->15</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/16">John<!-- --> <!-- -->16</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/17">John<!-- --> <!-- -->17</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/18">John<!-- --> <!-- -->18</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/19">John<!-- --> <!-- -->19</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/20">John<!-- --> <!-- -->20</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/43/21">John<!-- --> <!-- -->21</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"version":{"name":"NIV","vcode":"NIV"},"bible":{"bcode":43,"chapterCount":21,"name":"John","type":"new","vcode":"NIV"},"chapter":"11","verses":[{"bcode":43,"cnum":11,"content":"Now a man named Lazarus was sick.
