however, loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter--Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They were from nations about which the LORD had told the Israelites, &quot;You must not intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods.&quot; Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father had been.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molech the detestable god of the Ammonites.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Solomon did evil in the eyes of the LORD; he did not follow the LORD completely, as David his father had done.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">On a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable god of Moab, and for Molech the detestable god of the Ammonites.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The LORD became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the LORD&#x27;s command.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So the LORD said to Solomon, &quot;Since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees, which I commanded you, I will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Nevertheless, for the sake of David your father, I will not do it during your lifetime. I will tear it out of the hand of your son.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom from him, but will give him one tribe for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the LORD raised up against Solomon an adversary, Hadad the Edomite, from the royal line of Edom.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Earlier when David was fighting with Edom, Joab the commander of the army, who had gone up to bury the dead, had struck down all the men in Edom.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Joab and all the Israelites stayed there for six months, until they had destroyed all the men in Edom.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Hadad, still only a boy, fled to Egypt with some Edomite officials who had served his father.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They set out from Midian and went to Paran. Then taking men from Paran with them, they went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house and land and provided him with food.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Pharaoh was so pleased with Hadad that he gave him a sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes, in marriage.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The sister of Tahpenes bore him a son named Genubath, whom Tahpenes brought up in the royal palace. There Genubath lived with Pharaoh&#x27;s own children.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">While he was in Egypt, Hadad heard that David rested with his fathers and that Joab the commander of the army was also dead. Then Hadad said to Pharaoh, &quot;Let me go, that I may return to my own country.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;What have you lacked here that you want to go back to your own country?&quot; Pharaoh asked. &quot;Nothing,&quot; Hadad replied, &quot;but do let me go!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And God raised up against Solomon another adversary, Rezon son of Eliada, who had fled from his master, Hadadezer king of Zobah.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He gathered men around him and became the leader of a band of rebels when David destroyed the forces of Zobah ; the rebels went to Damascus, where they settled and took control.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Rezon was Israel&#x27;s adversary as long as Solomon lived, adding to the trouble caused by Hadad. So Rezon ruled in Aram and was hostile toward Israel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Also, Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled against the king. He was one of Solomon&#x27;s officials, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, and his mother was a widow named Zeruah.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Here is the account of how he rebelled against the king: Solomon had built the supporting terraces and had filled in the gap in the wall of the city of David his father.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now Jeroboam was a man of standing, and when Solomon saw how well the young man did his work, he put him in charge of the whole labor force of the house of Joseph.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">About that time Jeroboam was going out of Jerusalem, and Ahijah the prophet of Shiloh met him on the way, wearing a new cloak. The two of them were alone out in the country,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he said to Jeroboam, &quot;Take ten pieces for yourself, for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: &#x27;See, I am going to tear the kingdom out of Solomon&#x27;s hand and give you ten tribes.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But for the sake of my servant David and the city of Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, he will have one tribe.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I will do this because they have forsaken me and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Molech the god of the Ammonites, and have not walked in my ways, nor done what is right in my eyes, nor kept my statutes and laws as David, Solomon&#x27;s father, did.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot; &#x27;But I will not take the whole kingdom out of Solomon&#x27;s hand; I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David my servant, whom I chose and who observed my commands and statutes.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I will take the kingdom from his son&#x27;s hands and give you ten tribes.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I will give one tribe to his son so that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I chose to put my Name.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">However, as for you, I will take you, and you will rule over all that your heart desires; you will be king over Israel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If you do whatever I command you and walk in my ways and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and commands, as David my servant did, I will be with you. I will build you a dynasty as enduring as the one I built for David and will give Israel to you.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I will humble David&#x27;s descendants because of this, but not forever.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but Jeroboam fled to Egypt, to Shishak the king, and stayed there until Solomon&#x27;s death.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As for the other events of Solomon&#x27;s reign--all he did and the wisdom he displayed--are they not written in the book of the annals of Solomon?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son succeeded him as king.</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul
