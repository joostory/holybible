him, &quot;Let us look for a young virgin to attend the king and take care of him.

On hearing the sound of the trumpet, Joab asked, &quot;What&#x27;s the meaning of all the noise in the city?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Even as he was speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived.

A worthy man like you must be bringing good news.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Not at all!&quot; Jonathan answered. &quot;Our lord King David has made Solomon king.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and they have put him on the king&#x27;s mule,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon. From there they have gone up cheering, and the city resounds with it. That&#x27;s the noise you hear.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Moreover, Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Also, the royal officials have come to congratulate our lord King David, saying, &#x27;May your God make Solomon&#x27;s name more famous than yours and his throne greater than yours!&#x27; And the king bowed in worship on his bed</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and said, &#x27;Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has allowed my eyes to see a successor on my throne today.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At this, all Adonijah&#x27;s guests rose in alarm and dispersed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Adonijah, in fear of Solomon, went and took hold of the horns of the altar.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Solomon was told, &quot;Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon and is clinging to the horns of the altar. He says, &#x27;Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Solomon replied, &quot;If he shows himself to be a worthy man, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground; but if evil is found in him, he will die.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then King Solomon sent men, and they brought him down from the altar. And Adonijah came and bowed down to King Solomon, and Solomon said, &quot;Go to your home.&quot;</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60
