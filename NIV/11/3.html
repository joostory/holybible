He returned to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the Lord&#x27;s covenant and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then he gave a feast for all his court.</li><li>Now two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him.</li><li>One of them said, &quot;My lord, this woman and I live in the same house.

Don&#x27;t kill him!&quot; But the other said, &quot;Neither I nor you shall have him. Cut him in two!&quot;</li><li>Then the king gave his ruling: &quot;Give the living baby to the first woman.
