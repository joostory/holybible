Now Ahijah could not see; his sight was gone because of his age.</li><li>But the LORD had told Ahijah, &quot;Jeroboam&#x27;s wife is coming to ask you about her son, for he is ill, and you are to give her such and such an answer. When she arrives, she will pretend to be someone else.&quot;</li><li>So when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps at the door, he said, &quot;Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why this pretense? I have been sent to you with bad news.</li><li>Go, tell Jeroboam that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: &#x27;I raised you up from among the people and made you a leader over my people Israel.</li><li>I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you, but you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commands and followed me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes.</li><li>You have done more evil than all who lived before you.

He is the only one belonging to Jeroboam who will be buried, because he is the only one in the house of Jeroboam in whom the LORD, the God of Israel, has found anything good.</li><li>&quot;The LORD will raise up for himself a king over Israel who will cut off the family of Jeroboam. This is the day! What? Yes, even now.</li><li>And the LORD will strike Israel, so that it will be like a reed swaying in the water.
