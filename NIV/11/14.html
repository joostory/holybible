Then go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is there--the one who told me I would be king over this people.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Take ten loaves of bread with you, some cakes and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Jeroboam&#x27;s wife did what he said and went to Ahijah&#x27;s house in Shiloh. Now Ahijah could not see; his sight was gone because of his age.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But the LORD had told Ahijah, &quot;Jeroboam&#x27;s wife is coming to ask you about her son, for he is ill, and you are to give her such and such an answer. When she arrives, she will pretend to be someone else.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps at the door, he said, &quot;Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why this pretense? I have been sent to you with bad news.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Go, tell Jeroboam that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: &#x27;I raised you up from among the people and made you a leader over my people Israel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you, but you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commands and followed me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You have done more evil than all who lived before you. You have made for yourself other gods, idols made of metal; you have provoked me to anger and thrust me behind your back.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot; &#x27;Because of this, I am going to bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam.

His mother&#x27;s name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Judah did evil in the eyes of the LORD. By the sins they committed they stirred up his jealous anger more than their fathers had done.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They also set up for themselves high places, sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">There were even male shrine prostitutes in the land; the people engaged in all the detestable practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He carried off the treasures of the temple of the LORD and the treasures of the royal palace. He took everything, including all the gold shields Solomon had made.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Whenever the king went to the LORD&#x27;s temple, the guards bore the shields, and afterward they returned them to the guardroom.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As for the other events of Rehoboam&#x27;s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">There was continual warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And Rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David.
