In exchange I will give you a better vineyard or, if you prefer, I will pay you whatever it is worth.&quot;</li><li>But Naboth replied, &quot;The LORD forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers.&quot;</li><li>So Ahab went home, sullen and angry because Naboth the Jezreelite had said, &quot;I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.&quot; He lay on his bed sulking and refused to eat.</li><li>His wife Jezebel came in and asked him, &quot;Why are you so sullen? Why won&#x27;t you eat?&quot;</li><li>He answered her, &quot;Because I said to Naboth the Jezreelite, &#x27;Sell me your vineyard; or if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard in its place.&#x27; But he said, &#x27;I will not give you my vineyard.&#x27; &quot;</li><li>Jezebel his wife said, &quot;Is this how you act as king over Israel?
