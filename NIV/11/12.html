to Shechem, for all the Israelites had gone there to make him king.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this (he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), he returned from Egypt.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and the whole assembly of Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Rehoboam answered, &quot;Go away for three days and then come back to me.&quot; So the people went away.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. &quot;How would you advise me to answer these people?&quot; he asked.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They replied, &quot;If today you will be a servant to these people and serve them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He asked them, &quot;What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, &#x27;Lighten the yoke your father put on us&#x27;?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The young men who had grown up with him replied, &quot;Tell these people who have said to you, &#x27;Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter&#x27;-tell them, &#x27;My little finger is thicker than my father&#x27;s waist.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, &quot;Come back to me in three days.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The king answered the people harshly. Rejecting the advice given him by the elders,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">he followed the advice of the young men and said, &quot;My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from the LORD, to fulfill the word the LORD had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king: &quot;What share do we have in David, what part in Jesse&#x27;s son? To your tents, O Israel! Look after your own house, O David!&quot; So the Israelites went home.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam still ruled over them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram, who was in charge of forced labor, but all Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam, however, managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When all the Israelites heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mustered the whole house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin--a hundred and eighty thousand fighting men--to make war against the house of Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam son of Solomon.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But this word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, to the whole house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&#x27;This is what the LORD says: Do not go up to fight against your brothers, the Israelites. Go home, every one of you, for this is my doing.&#x27; &quot; So they obeyed the word of the LORD and went home again, as the LORD had ordered.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Jeroboam fortified Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. From there he went out and built up Peniel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jeroboam thought to himself, &quot;The kingdom will now likely revert to the house of David.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If these people go up to offer sacrifices at the temple of the LORD in Jerusalem, they will again give their allegiance to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah. They will kill me and return to King Rehoboam.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">After seeking advice, the king made two golden calves. He said to the people, &quot;It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">One he set up in Bethel, and the other in Dan.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And this thing became a sin; the people went even as far as Dan to worship the one there.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jeroboam built shrines on high places and appointed priests from all sorts of people, even though they were not Levites.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He instituted a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the festival held in Judah, and offered sacrifices on the altar. This he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves he had made. And at Bethel he also installed priests at the high places he had made.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a month of his own choosing, he offered sacrifices on the altar he had built at Bethel. So he instituted the festival for the Israelites and went up to the altar to make offerings.</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60
