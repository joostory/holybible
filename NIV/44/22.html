Then Paul said:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city. Under Gamaliel I was thoroughly trained in the law of our fathers and was just as zealous for God as any of you are today.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I persecuted the followers of this Way to their death, arresting both men and women and throwing them into prison,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">as also the high priest and all the Council can testify. I even obtained letters from them to their brothers in Damascus, and went there to bring these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;About noon as I came near Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, &#x27;Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me?&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot; &#x27;Who are you, Lord?&#x27; I asked. &quot; &#x27;I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting,&#x27; he replied.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">My companions saw the light, but they did not understand the voice of him who was speaking to me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;&#x27;What shall I do, Lord?&#x27; I asked. &quot;&#x27;Get up,&#x27; the Lord said, &#x27;and go into Damascus. There you will be told all that you have been assigned to do.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">My companions led me by the hand into Damascus, because the brilliance of the light had blinded me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;A man named Ananias came to see me. He was a devout observer of the law and highly respected by all the Jews living there.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He stood beside me and said, &#x27;Brother Saul, receive your sight!&#x27; And at that very moment I was able to see him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Then he said: &#x27;The God of our fathers has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You will be his witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And now what are you waiting for?

He directed that he be flogged and questioned in order to find out why the people were shouting at him like this.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As they stretched him out to flog him, Paul said to the centurion standing there, &quot;Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn&#x27;t even been found guilty?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and reported it. &quot;What are you going to do?&quot; he asked. &quot;This man is a Roman citizen.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The commander went to Paul and asked, &quot;Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?&quot; &quot;Yes, I am,&quot; he answered.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the commander said, &quot;I had to pay a big price for my citizenship.&quot; &quot;But I was born a citizen,&quot; Paul replied.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Those who were about to question him withdrew immediately. The commander himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put Paul, a Roman citizen, in chains.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The next day, since the commander wanted to find out exactly why Paul was being accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to assemble.
