Paul looked directly at him, saw that he had faith to be healed</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">and called out, &quot;Stand up on your feet!&quot; At that, the man jumped up and began to walk.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, &quot;The gods have come down to us in human form!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting:</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;Men, why are you doing this? We too are only men, human like you. We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made heaven and earth and sea and everything in them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">In the past, he let all nations go their own way.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Yet he has not left himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city. The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">They preached the good news in that city and won a large number of disciples. Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium and Antioch,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain true to the faith. &quot;We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God,&quot; they said.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church and, with prayer and fasting, committed them to the Lord, in whom they had put their trust.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">After going through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">and when they had preached the word in Perga,

the work they had now completed.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">On arriving there, they gathered the church together and reported all that God had done
