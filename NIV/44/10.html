The angel answered, &quot;Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">When the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">He told them everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">He became hungry and wanted something to eat, and while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then a voice told him, &quot;Get up, Peter.

Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Peter went down and said to the men, &quot;I&#x27;m the one you&#x27;re looking for. Why have you come?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">The men replied, &quot;We have come from Cornelius the centurion. He is a righteous and God-fearing man, who is respected by all the Jewish people. A holy angel told him to have you come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests. The next day Peter started out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went along.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">The following day he arrived in Caesarea.

But God has shown me that I should not call any man impure or unclean.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Cornelius answered: &quot;Four days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">and said, &#x27;Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then Peter began to speak: &quot;I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, telling the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">You know what has happened throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached--</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a tree,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen--by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
