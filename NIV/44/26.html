leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then Agrippa said to Paul, &quot;You have permission to speak for yourself.&quot; So Paul motioned with his hand and began his defense:</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to stand before you today as I make my defense against all the accusations of the Jews,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">and especially so because you are well acquainted with all the Jewish customs and controversies. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;The Jews all know the way I have lived ever since I was a child, from the beginning of my life in my own country, and also in Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">They have known me for a long time and can testify, if they are willing, that according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived as a Pharisee.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">And now it is because of my hope in what God has promised our fathers that I am on trial today.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">This is the promise our twelve tribes are hoping to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve God day and night. O king, it is because of this hope that the Jews are accusing me.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;I too was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">And that is just what I did in Jerusalem. On the authority of the chief priests I put many of the saints in prison, and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Many a time I went from one synagogue to another to have them punished, and I tried to force them to blaspheme. In my obsession against them, I even went to foreign cities to persecute them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">About noon, O king, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, blazing around me and my companions.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, &#x27;Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;Then I asked, &#x27;Who are you, Lord?&#x27; &quot; &#x27;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,&#x27; the Lord replied.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&#x27;Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen of me and what I will show you.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;So then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the vision from heaven.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and to the Gentiles also, I preached that they should repent and turn to God and prove their repentance by their deeds.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">That is why the Jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">But I have had God&#x27;s help to this very day, and so I stand here and testify to small and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen--</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">that the Christ would suffer and, as the first to rise from the dead, would proclaim light to his own people and to the Gentiles.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">At this point Festus interrupted Paul&#x27;s defense. &quot;You are out of your mind, Paul!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Your great learning is driving you insane.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;I am not insane, most excellent Festus,&quot; Paul replied. &quot;What I am saying is true and reasonable.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">The king is familiar with these things, and I can speak freely to him. I am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice, because it was not done in a corner.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then Agrippa said to Paul, &quot;Do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to be a Christian?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Paul replied, &quot;Short time or long--I pray God that not only you but all who are listening to me today may become what I am, except for these chains.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">The king rose, and with him the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">They left the room, and while talking with one another, they said, &quot;This man is not doing anything that deserves death or imprisonment.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Agrippa said to Festus, &quot;This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.&quot;</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4 text-base
