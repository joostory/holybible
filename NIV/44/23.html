I stand on trial because of my hope in the resurrection of the dead.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">(The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, and that there are neither angels nor spirits, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.)</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">There was a great uproar, and some of the teachers of the law who were Pharisees stood up and argued vigorously. &quot;We find nothing wrong with this man,&quot; they said. &quot;What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them.
