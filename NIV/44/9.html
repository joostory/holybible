was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord&#x27;s disciples. He went to the high priest</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, &quot;Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Who are you, Lord?&quot; Saul asked. &quot;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,&quot; he replied.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless; they heard the sound but did not see anyone.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, &quot;Ananias!&quot; &quot;Yes, Lord,&quot; he answered.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Lord told him, &quot;Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Lord,&quot; Ananias answered, &quot;I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But the Lord said to Ananias, &quot;Go! This man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before the Gentiles and their kings and before the people of Israel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, &quot;Brother Saul, the Lord--Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here--has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul&#x27;s eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and after taking some food, he regained his strength. Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">All those who heard him were astonished and asked, &quot;Isn&#x27;t he the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn&#x27;t he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Christ.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">After many days had gone by, the Jews conspired to kill him,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">but Saul learned of their plan. Day and night they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He talked and debated with the Grecian Jews, but they tried to kill him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the brothers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace. It was strengthened; and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it grew in numbers, living in the fear of the Lord.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As Peter traveled about the country, he went to visit the saints in Lydda.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">There he found a man named Aeneas, a paralytic who had been bedridden for eight years.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Aeneas,&quot; Peter said to him, &quot;Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and take care of your mat.&quot; Immediately Aeneas got up.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which, when translated, is Dorcas), who was always doing good and helping the poor.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">About that time she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Lydda was near Joppa; so when the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two men to him and urged him, &quot;Please come at once!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Peter went with them, and when he arrived he was taken upstairs to the room. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Peter sent them all out of the room; then he got down on his knees and prayed. Turning toward the dead woman, he said, &quot;Tabitha, get up.&quot; She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called the believers and the widows and presented her to them alive.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Peter stayed in Joppa for some time with a tanner named Simon.</li></ol></div><button
