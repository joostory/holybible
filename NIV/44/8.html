there, giving approval to his death. On that day a great persecution broke out against the church at Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christthere.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the crowds heard Philip and saw the miraculous signs he did, they all paid close attention to what he said.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">With shrieks, evil spirits came out of many, and many paralytics and cripples were healed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So there was great joy in that city.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now for some time a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and all the people, both high and low, gave him their attention and exclaimed, &quot;This man is the divine power known as the Great Power.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But when they believed Philip as he preached the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Simon himself believed and was baptized. And he followed Philip everywhere, astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had simply been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles&#x27; hands, he offered them money</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and said, &quot;Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Peter answered: &quot;May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money!</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right before God.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord.

This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the book of Isaiah the prophet.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Spirit told Philip, &quot;Go to that chariot and stay near it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. &quot;Do you understand what you are reading?&quot; Philip asked.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;How can I,&quot; he said, &quot;unless someone explains it to me?&quot; So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The eunuch was reading this passage of Scripture: &quot;He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In his humiliation he was deprived of justice. Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The eunuch asked Philip, &quot;Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, &quot;Look, here is water. Why shouldn&#x27;t I be baptized?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677"></li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0
