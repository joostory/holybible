class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">They seized Peter and John, and because it was evening, they put them in jail until the next day.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">But many who heard the message believed, and the number of men grew to about five thousand.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">The next day the rulers, elders and teachers of the law met in Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and the other men of the high priest&#x27;s family.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: &quot;By what power or what name did you do this?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: &quot;Rulers and elders of the people!</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a cripple and are asked how he was healed,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">He is &quot; &#x27;the stone you builders rejected, which has become the capstone.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2

mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, there was nothing they could say.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and then conferred together.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;What are we going to do with these men?&quot; they asked. &quot;Everybody living in Jerusalem knows they have done an outstanding miracle, and we cannot deny it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, we must warn these men to speak no longer to anyone in this name.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">But Peter and John replied, &quot;Judge for yourselves whether it is right in God&#x27;s sight to obey you rather than God.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">For we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">After further threats they let them go. They could not decide how to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">On their release, Peter and John went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God. &quot;Sovereign Lord,&quot; they said, &quot;you made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and everything in them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our father David: &quot; &#x27;Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the Lord and against his Anointed One.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in this city to conspire against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">They did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Stretch out your hand to heal and perform miraculous signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of his possessions was his own, but they shared everything they had.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and much grace was upon them all.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">There were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned lands or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">and put it at the apostles&#x27; feet, and it was distributed to anyone as he had need.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means Son of Encouragement),</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the
