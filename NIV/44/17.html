passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As his custom was, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">explaining and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead. &quot;This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Christ,&quot; he said.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and not a few prominent women.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But the Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to Jason&#x27;s house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials, shouting: &quot;These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar&#x27;s decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As soon as it was night, the brothers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Many of the Jews believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, they went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The brothers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The men who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to dispute with him. Some of them asked, &quot;What is this babbler trying to say?&quot; Others remarked, &quot;He seems to be advocating foreign gods.&quot; They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, &quot;May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we want to know what they mean.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">(All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.)</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: &quot;Men of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">God did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&#x27;For in him we live and move and have our being.&#x27; As some of your own poets have said, &#x27;We are his offspring.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Therefore since we are God&#x27;s offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone--an image made by man&#x27;s design and skill.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, &quot;We want to hear you again on this subject.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At that, Paul left the Council.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">A few men became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others.</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto
