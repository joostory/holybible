And after it was sold, wasn&#x27;t the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing?

Look! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">At that moment she fell down at his feet and died.
