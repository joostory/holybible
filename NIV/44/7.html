But God promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land, even though at that time Abraham had no child.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">God spoke to him in this way: &#x27;Your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,&#x27; God said, &#x27;and afterward they will come out of that country and worship me in this place.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision.

Later Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph, they sold him as a slave into Egypt. But God was with him</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">and rescued him from all his troubles.

He tried to reconcile them by saying, &#x27;Men, you are brothers; why do you want to hurt each other?&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;But the man who was mistreating the other pushed Moses aside and said, &#x27;Who made you ruler and judge over us?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">When Moses heard this, he fled to Midian, where he settled as a foreigner and had two sons.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">When he saw this, he was amazed at the sight. As he went over to look more closely, he heard the Lord&#x27;s voice:</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&#x27;I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.&#x27; Moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;Then the Lord said to him, &#x27;Take off your sandals; the place where you are standing is holy ground.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">I have indeed seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groaning and have come down to set them free. Now come, I will send you back to Egypt.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;This is the same Moses whom they had rejected with the words, &#x27;Who made you ruler and judge?&#x27; He was sent to be their ruler and deliverer by God himself, through the angel who appeared to him in the bush.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">He led them out of Egypt and did wonders and miraculous signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea and for forty years in the desert.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;This is that Moses who told the Israelites, &#x27;God will send you a prophet like me from your own people.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">He was in the assembly in the desert, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers; and he received living words to pass on to us.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;But our fathers refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">They told Aaron, &#x27;Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who led us out of Egypt--we don&#x27;t know what has happened to him!&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">That was the time they made an idol in the form of a calf. They brought sacrifices to it and held a celebration in honor of what their hands had made.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">But God turned away and gave them over to the worship of the heavenly bodies. This agrees with what is written in the book of the prophets: &quot; &#x27;Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the desert, O house of Israel?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">You have lifted up the shrine of Molech and the star of your god Rephan, the idols you made to worship. Therefore I will send you into exile&#x27; beyond Babylon.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;Our forefathers had the tabernacle of the Testimony with them in the desert. It had been made as God directed Moses, according to the pattern he had seen.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Having received the tabernacle, our fathers under Joshua brought it with them when they took the land from the nations God drove out before them. It remained in the land until the time of David,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">who enjoyed God&#x27;s favor and asked that he might provide a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">But it was Solomon who built the house for him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;However, the Most High does not live in houses made by men. As the prophet says:</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot; &#x27;Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me? says the Lord. Or where will my resting place be?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Has not my hand made all these things?&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit!</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him--</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">When they heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;Look,&quot; he said, &quot;I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">At this they covered their ears and, yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed at him,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses laid their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, &quot;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then he fell on his knees and cried out, &quot;Lord, do not hold this sin against them.&quot; When he had said this, he fell asleep.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4"><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a href="/NIV"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" class="h-5 w-5"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.75 19.5L8.25 12l7.5-7.5"></path></svg></a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/1">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/2">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->2</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/3">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->3</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/4">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->4</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/5">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->5</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/6">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->6</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="active" href="/NIV/44/7">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->7</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/8">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->8</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/9">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->9</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/10">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->10</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/11">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->11</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/12">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->12</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/13">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->13</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/14">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->14</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/15">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->15</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/16">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->16</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/17">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->17</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/18">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->18</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/19">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->19</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/20">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->20</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/21">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->21</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/22">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->22</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/23">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->23</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/24">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->24</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/25">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->25</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/26">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->26</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/27">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->27</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/44/28">Acts<!-- --> <!-- -->28</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"version":{"name":"NIV","vcode":"NIV"},"bible":{"bcode":44,"chapterCount":28,"name":"Acts","type":"new","vcode":"NIV"},"chapter":"7","verses":[{"bcode":44,"cnum":7,"content":"Then the high priest asked him, \"Are these charges true?\"","vcode":"NIV","vnum":1},{"bcode":44,"cnum":7,"content":"To this he replied: \"Brothers and fathers, listen to me!
