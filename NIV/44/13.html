John was with them as their helper.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They traveled through the whole island until they came to Paphos.

You are going to be blind, and for a time you will be unable to see the light of the sun.&quot; Immediately mist and darkness came over him, and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was amazed at the teaching about the Lord.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">From Paphos, Paul and his companions sailed to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them to return to Jerusalem.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">From Perga they went on to Pisidian Antioch.

Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For this is what the Lord has commanded us: &quot; &#x27;I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.&#x27;&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The word of the Lord spread through the whole region.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But the Jews incited the God-fearing women of high standing and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So they shook the dust from their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy
