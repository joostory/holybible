When the wind did not allow us to hold our course, we sailed to the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.</li><li>We moved along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.</li><li>Much time had been lost, and sailing had already become dangerous because by now it was after the Fast. So Paul warned them,</li><li>&quot;Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo, and to our own lives also.&quot;</li><li>But the centurion, instead of listening to what Paul said, followed the advice of the pilot and of the owner of the ship.</li><li>Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided that we should sail on, hoping to reach Phoenix and winter there. This was a harbor in Crete, facing both southwest and northwest.</li><li>When a gentle south wind began to blow, they thought they had obtained what they wanted; so they weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of Crete.</li><li>Before very long, a wind of hurricane force, called the &quot;northeaster,&quot; swept down from the island.</li><li>The ship was caught by the storm and could not head into the wind; so we gave way to it and were driven along.</li><li>As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were hardly able to make the lifeboat secure.</li><li>When the men had hoisted it aboard, they passed ropes under the ship itself to hold it together. Fearing that they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be driven along.</li><li>We took such a violent battering from the storm that the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard.</li><li>On the third day, they threw the ship&#x27;s tackle overboard with their own hands.</li><li>When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging, we finally gave up all hope of being saved.</li><li>After the men had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up before them and said: &quot;Men, you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete; then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss.</li><li>But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be lost; only the ship will be destroyed.</li><li>Last night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood beside me</li><li>and said, &#x27;Do not be afraid, Paul.

You need it to survive. Not one of you will lose a single hair from his head.&quot;</li><li>After he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat.</li><li>They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves.</li><li>Altogether there were 276 of us on board.</li><li>When they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.</li><li>When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could.</li><li>Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach.</li><li>But the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground.
