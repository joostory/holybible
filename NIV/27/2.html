tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So the king summoned the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers to tell him what he had dreamed. When they came in and stood before the king,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">he said to them, &quot;I have had a dream that troubles me and I want to know what it means. &quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic, &quot;O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The king replied to the astrologers, &quot;This is what I have firmly decided: If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it, I will have you cut into pieces and your houses turned into piles of rubble.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But if you tell me the dream and explain it, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and interpret it for me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Once more they replied, &quot;Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then the king answered, &quot;I am certain that you are trying to gain time, because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided:</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">If you do not tell me the dream, there is just one penalty for you. You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things, hoping the situation will change. So then, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can interpret it for me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The astrologers answered the king, &quot;There is not a man on earth who can do what the king asks! No king, however great and mighty, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods, and they do not live among men.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When Arioch, the commander of the king&#x27;s guard, had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He asked the king&#x27;s officer, &quot;Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?&quot; Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">At this, Daniel went in to the king and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">and said: &quot;Praise be to the name of God for ever and ever; wisdom and power are his.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He changes times and seasons; he sets up kings and deposes them. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what lies in darkness, and light dwells with him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">I thank and praise you, O God of my fathers: You have given me wisdom and power, you have made known to me what we asked of you, you have made known to us the dream of the king.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, &quot;Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said, &quot;I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The king asked Daniel (also called Belteshazzar), &quot;Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Daniel replied, &quot;No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you lay on your bed are these:</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;As you were lying there, O king, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than other living men, but so that you, O king, may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;You looked, O king, and there before you stood a large statue--an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were broken to pieces at the same time and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">in your hands he has placed mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds of the air. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;After you, another kingdom will rise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron--for iron breaks and smashes everything--and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands--a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces. &quot;The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true and the interpretation is trustworthy.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The king said to Daniel, &quot;Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Moreover, at Daniel&#x27;s request the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego administrators over the province of Babylon, while Daniel himself remained at the royal court.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4 text-base gap-y-2 w-full"><li class="__className_872c54"><a href="/NIV"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-5 w-5"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.75 19.5 8.25 12l7.5-7.5"></path></svg></a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/27/1">Daniel<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="menu-active" href="/NIV/27/2">Daniel<!-- --> <!-- -->2</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/27/3">Daniel<!-- --> <!-- -->3</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/27/4">Daniel<!-- --> <!-- -->4</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/27/5">Daniel<!-- --> <!-- -->5</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/27/6">Daniel<!-- --> <!-- -->6</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/27/7">Daniel<!-- --> <!-- -->7</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/27/8">Daniel<!-- --> <!-- -->8</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/27/9">Daniel<!-- --> <!-- -->9</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/27/10">Daniel<!-- --> <!-- -->10</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/27/11">Daniel<!-- --> <!-- -->11</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/27/12">Daniel<!-- --> <!-- -->12</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"version":{"name":"NIV","vcode":"NIV"},"bible":{"bcode":27,"chapterCount":12,"name":"Daniel","type":"old","vcode":"NIV"},"chapter":"2","verses":[{"bcode":27,"cnum":2,"content":"In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his mind was troubled and he could not sleep.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":1},{"bcode":27,"cnum":2,"content":"So the king summoned the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers to tell him what he had dreamed.
