They have not hurt me, because I was found innocent in his sight. Nor have I ever done any wrong before you, O king.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">The king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift Daniel out of the den.
