He was driven away from people and ate grass like cattle. His body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my sanity was restored. Then I praised the Most High; I honored and glorified him who lives forever. His dominion is an eternal dominion; his kingdom endures from generation to generation.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing. He does as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the earth. No one can hold back his hand or say to him: &quot;What have you done?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">At the same time that my sanity was restored, my honor and splendor were returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My advisers and nobles sought me out, and I was restored to my throne and became even greater than before.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, because everything he does is right and all his ways are just.
