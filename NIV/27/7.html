year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was lying on his bed. He wrote down the substance of his dream.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Daniel said: &quot;In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up out of the sea.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a man, and the heart of a man was given to it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, &#x27;Get up and eat your fill of flesh!&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast--terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth that spoke boastfully.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;As I looked, &quot;thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow; the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">A river of fire was flowing, coming out from before him. Thousands upon thousands attended him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court was seated, and the books were opened.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">(The other beasts had been stripped of their authority, but were allowed to live for a period of time.)</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I approached one of those standing there and asked him the true meaning of all this. &quot;So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&#x27;The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever--yes, for ever and ever.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws--the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell--the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As I watched, this horn was waging war against the saints and defeating them,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;He gave me this explanation: &#x27;The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He will speak against the Most High and oppress his saints and try to change the set times and the laws. The saints will be handed over to him for a time, times and half a time.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot; &#x27;But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be handed over to the saints, the people of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey him.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;This is the end of the matter. I, Daniel, was deeply troubled by my thoughts, and my face turned pale, but I kept the matter to myself.&quot;</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0
