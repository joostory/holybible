He wrote down the substance of his dream.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">Daniel said: &quot;In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up out of the sea.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">&quot;The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a man, and the heart of a man was given to it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">&quot;And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, &#x27;Get up and eat your fill of flesh!&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">&quot;After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">&quot;After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast--terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">&quot;While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth that spoke boastfully.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">&quot;As I looked, &quot;thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow; the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">A river of fire was flowing, coming out from before him.

The court was seated, and the books were opened.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">&quot;Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking.

He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men of every language worshiped him.

It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">He will speak against the Most High and oppress his saints and try to change the set times and the laws. The saints will be handed over to him for a time, times and half a time.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">&quot; &#x27;But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter noto_serif_kr_10194567-module__M0W2xW__className">Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be handed over to the saints, the people of the Most High.
