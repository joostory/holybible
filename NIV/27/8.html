Elam; in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">I looked up, and there before me was a ram with two horns, standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">I watched the ram as he charged toward the west and the north and the south. No animal could stand against him, and none could rescue from his power. He did as he pleased and became great.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">As I was thinking about this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between his eyes came from the west, crossing the whole earth without touching the ground.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and charged at him in great rage.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">I saw him attack the ram furiously, striking the ram and shattering his two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against him; the goat knocked him to the ground and trampled on him, and none could rescue the ram from his power.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The goat became very great, but at the height of his power his large horn was broken off, and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Out of one of them came another horn, which started small but grew in power to the south and to the east and toward the Beautiful Land.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">It grew until it reached the host of the heavens, and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">It set itself up to be as great as the Prince of the host; it took away the daily sacrifice from him, and the place of his sanctuary was brought low.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Because of rebellion, the host of the saints and the daily sacrifice were given over to it.
