Can they bring the stones back to life from those heaps of rubble--burned as they are?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Tobiah the Ammonite, who was at his side, said, &quot;What they are building--if even a fox climbed up on it, he would break down their wall of stones!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Hear us, O our God, for we are despised.

Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked. But the man who sounded the trumpet stayed with me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then I said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, &quot;The work is extensive and spread out, and we are widely separated from each other along the wall.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, join us there.
