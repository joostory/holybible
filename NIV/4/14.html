By your power you brought these people up from among them.</li><li>And they will tell the inhabitants of this land about it. They have already heard that you, O LORD, are with these people and that you, O LORD, have been seen face to face, that your cloud stays over them, and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.</li><li>If you put these people to death all at one time, the nations who have heard this report about you will say,</li><li>&#x27;The LORD was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them on oath; so he slaughtered them in the desert.&#x27;</li><li>&quot;Now may the Lord&#x27;s strength be displayed, just as you have declared:</li><li>&#x27;The LORD is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion.
