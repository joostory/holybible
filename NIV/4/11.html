What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me?</li><li>Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth? Why do you tell me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries an infant, to the land you promised on oath to their forefathers?</li><li>Where can I get meat for all these people?

Have them come to the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with you.</li><li>I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take of the Spirit that is on you and put the Spirit on them. They will help you carry the burden of the people so that you will not have to carry it alone.</li><li>&quot;Tell the people: &#x27;Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, when you will eat meat. The LORD heard you when you wailed, &quot;If only we had meat to eat! We were better off in Egypt!&quot; Now the LORD will give you meat, and you will eat it.</li><li>You will not eat it for just one day, or two days, or five, ten or twenty days,</li><li>but for a whole month--until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it--because you have rejected the LORD, who is among you, and have wailed before him, saying, &quot;Why did we ever leave Egypt?&quot; &#x27; &quot;</li><li>But Moses said, &quot;Here I am among six hundred thousand men on foot, and you say, &#x27;I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!&#x27;</li><li>Would they have enough if flocks and herds were slaughtered for them? Would they have enough if all the fish in the sea were caught for them?&quot;</li><li>The LORD answered Moses, &quot;Is the LORD&#x27;s arm too short?

He brought together seventy of their elders and had them stand around the Tent.</li><li>Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke with him, and he took of the Spirit that was on him and put the Spirit on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did not do so again.</li><li>However, two men, whose names were Eldad and Medad, had remained in the camp.

I wish that all the LORD&#x27;s people were prophets and that the LORD would put his Spirit on them!&quot;</li><li>Then Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.</li><li>Now a wind went out from the LORD and drove quail in from the sea. It brought them down all around the camp to about three feet above the ground, as far as a day&#x27;s walk in any direction.</li><li>All that day and night and all the next day the people went out and gathered quail.
