__className_a5c677">and rose up against Moses. With them were 250 Israelite men, well-known community leaders who had been appointed members of the council.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They came as a group to oppose Moses and Aaron and said to them, &quot;You have gone too far! The whole community is holy, every one of them, and the LORD is with them. Why then do you set yourselves above the LORD&#x27;s assembly?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Moses heard this, he fell facedown.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he said to Korah and all his followers: &quot;In the morning the LORD will show who belongs to him and who is holy, and he will have that person come near him. The man he chooses he will cause to come near him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">You, Korah, and all your followers are to do this: Take censers</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and tomorrow put fire and incense in them before the LORD. The man the LORD chooses will be the one who is holy. You Levites have gone too far!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Moses also said to Korah, &quot;Now listen, you Levites!</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Isn&#x27;t it enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelite community and brought you near himself to do the work at the LORD&#x27;s tabernacle and to stand before the community and minister to them?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He has brought you and all your fellow Levites near himself, but now you are trying to get the priesthood too.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">It is against the LORD that you and all your followers have banded together. Who is Aaron that you should grumble against him?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. But they said, &quot;We will not come!</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Isn&#x27;t it enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the desert? And now you also want to lord it over us?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Moreover, you haven&#x27;t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? No, we will not come!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, &quot;Do not accept their offering. I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, nor have I wronged any of them.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Moses said to Korah, &quot;You and all your followers are to appear before the LORD tomorrow--you and they and Aaron.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Each man is to take his censer and put incense in it--250 censers in all--and present it before the LORD. You and Aaron are to present your censers also.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So each man took his censer, put fire and incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Korah had gathered all his followers in opposition to them at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the glory of the LORD appeared to the entire assembly.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Separate yourselves from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and cried out, &quot;O God, God of the spirits of all mankind, will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man sins?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the LORD said to Moses,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Say to the assembly, &#x27;Move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He warned the assembly, &quot;Move back from the tents of these wicked men! Do not touch anything belonging to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing with their wives, children and little ones at the entrances to their tents.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Moses said, &quot;This is how you will know that the LORD has sent me to do all these things and that it was not my idea:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If these men die a natural death and experience only what usually happens to men, then the LORD has not sent me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But if the LORD brings about something totally new, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them, with everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the grave, then you will know that these men have treated the LORD with contempt.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As soon as he finished saying all this, the ground under them split apart</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, with their households and all Korah&#x27;s men and all their possessions.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They went down alive into the grave, with everything they owned; the earth closed over them, and they perished and were gone from the community.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At their cries, all the Israelites around them fled, shouting, &quot;The earth is going to swallow us too!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And fire came out from the LORD and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The LORD said to Moses,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Tell Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, to take the censers out of the smoldering remains and scatter the coals some distance away, for the censers are holy-</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">the censers of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives. Hammer the censers into sheets to overlay the altar, for they were presented before the LORD and have become holy. Let them be a sign to the Israelites.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned up, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">as the LORD directed him through Moses. This was to remind the Israelites that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to burn incense before the LORD, or he would become like Korah and his followers.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The next day the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. &quot;You have killed the LORD&#x27;s people,&quot; they said.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But when the assembly gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned toward the Tent of Meeting, suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the LORD appeared.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the Tent of Meeting,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and the LORD said to Moses,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Get away from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once.&quot; And they fell facedown.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Moses said to Aaron, &quot;Take your censer and put incense in it, along with fire from the altar, and hurry to the assembly to make atonement for them. Wrath has come out from the LORD; the plague has started.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly. The plague had already started among the people, but Aaron offered the incense and made atonement for them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague stopped.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But 14,700 people died from the plague, in addition to those who had died because of Korah.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, for the plague had stopped.</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4 text-base gap-y-2
