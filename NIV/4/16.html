With them were 250 Israelite men, well-known community leaders who had been appointed members of the council.</li><li>They came as a group to oppose Moses and Aaron and said to them, &quot;You have gone too far! The whole community is holy, every one of them, and the LORD is with them. Why then do you set yourselves above the LORD&#x27;s assembly?&quot;</li><li>When Moses heard this, he fell facedown.</li><li>Then he said to Korah and all his followers: &quot;In the morning the LORD will show who belongs to him and who is holy, and he will have that person come near him. The man he chooses he will cause to come near him.</li><li>You, Korah, and all your followers are to do this: Take censers</li><li>and tomorrow put fire and incense in them before the LORD.

Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? No, we will not come!&quot;</li><li>Then Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, &quot;Do not accept their offering. I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, nor have I wronged any of them.&quot;</li><li>Moses said to Korah, &quot;You and all your followers are to appear before the LORD tomorrow--you and they and Aaron.</li><li>Each man is to take his censer and put incense in it--250 censers in all--and present it before the LORD. You and Aaron are to present your censers also.&quot;</li><li>So each man took his censer, put fire and incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.</li><li>When Korah had gathered all his followers in opposition to them at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the glory of the LORD appeared to the entire assembly.</li><li>The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,</li><li>&quot;Separate yourselves from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once.&quot;</li><li>But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and cried out, &quot;O God, God of the spirits of all mankind, will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man sins?&quot;</li><li>Then the LORD said to Moses,</li><li>&quot;Say to the assembly, &#x27;Move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.&#x27; &quot;</li><li>Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.</li><li>He warned the assembly, &quot;Move back from the tents of these wicked men! Do not touch anything belonging to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins.&quot;</li><li>So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing with their wives, children and little ones at the entrances to their tents.</li><li>Then Moses said, &quot;This is how you will know that the LORD has sent me to do all these things and that it was not my idea:</li><li>If these men die a natural death and experience only what usually happens to men, then the LORD has not sent me.</li><li>But if the LORD brings about something totally new, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them, with everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the grave, then you will know that these men have treated the LORD with contempt.&quot;</li><li>As soon as he finished saying all this, the ground under them split apart</li><li>and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, with their households and all Korah&#x27;s men and all their possessions.</li><li>They went down alive into the grave, with everything they owned; the earth closed over them, and they perished and were gone from the community.</li><li>At their cries, all the Israelites around them fled, shouting, &quot;The earth is going to swallow us too!&quot;</li><li>And fire came out from the LORD and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense.</li><li>The LORD said to Moses,</li><li>&quot;Tell Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, to take the censers out of the smoldering remains and scatter the coals some distance away, for the censers are holy-</li><li>the censers of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives.

Let them be a sign to the Israelites.&quot;</li><li>So Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned up, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar,</li><li>as the LORD directed him through Moses. This was to remind the Israelites that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to burn incense before the LORD, or he would become like Korah and his followers.</li><li>The next day the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. &quot;You have killed the LORD&#x27;s people,&quot; they said.</li><li>But when the assembly gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned toward the Tent of Meeting, suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the LORD appeared.</li><li>Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the Tent of Meeting,</li><li>and the LORD said to Moses,</li><li>&quot;Get away from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once.&quot; And they fell facedown.</li><li>Then Moses said to Aaron, &quot;Take your censer and put incense in it, along with fire from the altar, and hurry to the assembly to make atonement for them.
