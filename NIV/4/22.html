Israelites traveled to the plains of Moab and camped along the Jordan across from Jericho.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and Moab was terrified because there were so many people. Indeed, Moab was filled with dread because of the Israelites.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Moabites said to the elders of Midian, &quot;This horde is going to lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.&quot; So Balak son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, who was at Pethor, near the River, in his native land. Balak said: &quot;A people has come out of Egypt; they cover the face of the land and have settled next to me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now come and put a curse on these people, because they are too powerful for me. Perhaps then I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the country. For I know that those you bless are blessed, and those you curse are cursed.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The elders of Moab and Midian left, taking with them the fee for divination. When they came to Balaam, they told him what Balak had said.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Spend the night here,&quot; Balaam said to them, &quot;and I will bring you back the answer the LORD gives me.&quot; So the Moabite princes stayed with him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">God came to Balaam and asked, &quot;Who are these men with you?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Balaam said to God, &quot;Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&#x27;A people that has come out of Egypt covers the face of the land.

Come and put a curse on these people for me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Balaam answered them, &quot;Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not do anything great or small to go beyond the command of the LORD my God.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now stay here tonight as the others did, and I will find out what else the LORD will tell me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">That night God came to Balaam and said, &quot;Since these men have come to summon you, go with them, but do only what I tell you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Moab.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But God was very angry when he went, and the angel of the LORD stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, she turned off the road into a field.

So he beat her again.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the angel of the LORD moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, either to the right or to the left.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam, and he was angry and beat her with his staff.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the LORD opened the donkey&#x27;s mouth, and she said to Balaam, &quot;What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Balaam answered the donkey, &quot;You have made a fool of me! If I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The donkey said to Balaam, &quot;Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden, to this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; he said.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the LORD opened Balaam&#x27;s eyes, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with his sword drawn. So he bowed low and fell facedown.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The angel of the LORD asked him, &quot;Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? I have come here to oppose you because your path is a reckless one before me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If she had not turned away, I would certainly have killed you by now, but I would have spared her.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, &quot;I have sinned. I did not realize you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now if you are displeased, I will go back.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The angel of the LORD said to Balaam, &quot;Go with the men, but speak only what I tell you.&quot; So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite town on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Balak said to Balaam, &quot;Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why didn&#x27;t you come to me? Am I really not able to reward you?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Well, I have come to you now,&quot; Balaam replied. &quot;But can I say just anything? I must speak only what God puts in my mouth.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2
