leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim, he attacked the Israelites and captured some of them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then Israel made this vow to the LORD : &quot;If you will deliver these people into our hands, we will totally destroy their cities.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">The LORD listened to Israel&#x27;s plea and gave the Canaanites over to them. They completely destroyed them and their towns; so the place was named Hormah.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">They traveled from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea, to go around Edom. But the people grew impatient on the way;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">they spoke against God and against Moses, and said, &quot;Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the desert? There is no bread! There is no water! And we detest this miserable food!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then the LORD sent venomous snakes among them; they bit the people and many Israelites died.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">The people came to Moses and said, &quot;We sinned when we spoke against the LORD and against you. Pray that the LORD will take the snakes away from us.&quot; So Moses prayed for the people.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">The LORD said to Moses, &quot;Make a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, he lived.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">The Israelites moved on and camped at Oboth.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then they set out from Oboth and camped in Iye Abarim, in the desert that faces Moab toward the sunrise.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">From there they moved on and camped in the Zered Valley.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">They set out from there and camped alongside the Arnon, which is in the desert extending into Amorite territory. The Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">That is why the Book of the Wars of the LORD says: &quot;...Waheb in Suphah and the ravines, the Arnon</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">and the slopes of the ravines that lead to the site of Ar and lie along the border of Moab.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">From there they continued on to Beer, the well where the LORD said to Moses, &quot;Gather the people together and I will give them water.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then Israel sang this song: &quot;Spring up, O well! Sing about it,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">about the well that the princes dug, that the nobles of the people sank-- the nobles with scepters and staffs.&quot; Then they went from the desert to Mattanah,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab where the top of Pisgah overlooks the wasteland.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Israel sent messengers to say to Sihon king of the Amorites:</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;Let us pass through your country. We will not turn aside into any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the king&#x27;s highway until we have passed through your territory.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. He mustered his entire army and marched out into the desert against Israel. When he reached Jahaz, he fought with Israel.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Israel, however, put him to the sword and took over his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, but only as far as the Ammonites, because their border was fortified.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Israel captured all the cities of the Amorites and occupied them, including Heshbon and all its surrounding settlements.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken from him all his land as far as the Arnon.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">That is why the poets say: &quot;Come to Heshbon and let it be rebuilt; let Sihon&#x27;s city be restored.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;Fire went out from Heshbon, a blaze from the city of Sihon. It consumed Ar of Moab, the citizens of Arnon&#x27;s heights.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Woe to you, O Moab! You are destroyed, O people of Chemosh! He has given up his sons as fugitives and his daughters as captives to Sihon king of the Amorites.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;But we have overthrown them; Heshbon is destroyed all the way to Dibon. We have demolished them as far as Nophah, which extends to Medeba.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">So Israel settled in the land of the Amorites.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">After Moses had sent spies to Jazer, the Israelites captured its surrounding settlements and drove out the Amorites who were there.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then they turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan and his whole army marched out to meet them in battle at Edrei.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">The LORD said to Moses, &quot;Do not be afraid of him, for I have handed him over to you, with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">So they struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army, leaving them no survivors. And they took possession of his land.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4
