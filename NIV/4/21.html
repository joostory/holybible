They completely destroyed them and their towns; so the place was named Hormah.</li><li>They traveled from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea, to go around Edom. But the people grew impatient on the way;</li><li>they spoke against God and against Moses, and said, &quot;Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the desert? There is no bread! There is no water! And we detest this miserable food!&quot;</li><li>Then the LORD sent venomous snakes among them; they bit the people and many Israelites died.</li><li>The people came to Moses and said, &quot;We sinned when we spoke against the LORD and against you. Pray that the LORD will take the snakes away from us.&quot; So Moses prayed for the people.</li><li>The LORD said to Moses, &quot;Make a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live.&quot;</li><li>So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, he lived.</li><li>The Israelites moved on and camped at Oboth.</li><li>Then they set out from Oboth and camped in Iye Abarim, in the desert that faces Moab toward the sunrise.</li><li>From there they moved on and camped in the Zered Valley.</li><li>They set out from there and camped alongside the Arnon, which is in the desert extending into Amorite territory. The Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</li><li>That is why the Book of the Wars of the LORD says: &quot;...Waheb in Suphah and the ravines, the Arnon</li><li>and the slopes of the ravines that lead to the site of Ar and lie along the border of Moab.&quot;</li><li>From there they continued on to Beer, the well where the LORD said to Moses, &quot;Gather the people together and I will give them water.&quot;</li><li>Then Israel sang this song: &quot;Spring up, O well! Sing about it,</li><li>about the well that the princes dug, that the nobles of the people sank-- the nobles with scepters and staffs.&quot; Then they went from the desert to Mattanah,</li><li>from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth,</li><li>and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab where the top of Pisgah overlooks the wasteland.</li><li>Israel sent messengers to say to Sihon king of the Amorites:</li><li>&quot;Let us pass through your country. We will not turn aside into any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the king&#x27;s highway until we have passed through your territory.&quot;</li><li>But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory.

Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon.&quot;</li><li>So they struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army, leaving them no survivors.
