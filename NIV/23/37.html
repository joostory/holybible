Therefore pray for the remnant that still survives.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">When King Hezekiah&#x27;s officials came to Isaiah,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Isaiah said to them, &quot;Tell your master, &#x27;This is what the LORD says: Do not be afraid of what you have heard--those words with which the underlings of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Listen!

And you have said, &#x27;With my many chariots I have ascended the heights of the mountains, the utmost heights of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars, the choicest of its pines. I have reached its remotest heights, the finest of its forests.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">I have dug wells in foreign lands and drunk the water there.

Long ago I ordained it. In days of old I planned it; now I have brought it to pass, that you have turned fortified cities into piles of stone.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Their people, drained of power, are dismayed and put to shame. They are like plants in the field, like tender green shoots, like grass sprouting on the roof, scorched before it grows up.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;But I know where you stay and when you come and go and how you rage against me.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Because you rage against me and because your insolence has reached my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will make you return by the way you came.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;This will be the sign for you, O Hezekiah: &quot;This year you will eat what grows by itself, and the second year what springs from that.

The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;Therefore this is what the LORD says concerning the king of Assyria: &quot;He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here.

When the people got up the next morning--there were all the dead bodies!</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer cut him down with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat.
