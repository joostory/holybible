I will pour out my Spirit on your offspring, and my blessing on your descendants.</li><li>They will spring up like grass in a meadow, like poplar trees by flowing streams.</li><li>One will say, &#x27;I belong to the LORD &#x27;; another will call himself by the name of Jacob; still another will write on his hand, &#x27;The LORD&#x27;s,&#x27; and will take the name Israel.</li><li>&quot;This is what the LORD says-- Israel&#x27;s King and Redeemer, the LORD Almighty: I am the first and I am the last; apart from me there is no God.</li><li>Who then is like me? Let him proclaim it. Let him declare and lay out before me what has happened since I established my ancient people, and what is yet to come-- yes, let him foretell what will come.</li><li>Do not tremble, do not be afraid. Did I not proclaim this and foretell it long ago? You are my witnesses. Is there any God besides me? No, there is no other Rock; I know not one.&quot;</li><li>All who make idols are nothing, and the things they treasure are worthless.

you in the womb: I am the LORD, who has made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who spread out the earth by myself,</li><li>who foils the signs of false prophets and makes fools of
