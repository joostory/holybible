he made me into a polished arrow and concealed me in his quiver.</li><li>He said to me, &quot;You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will display my splendor.&quot;</li><li>But I said, &quot;I have labored to no purpose; I have spent my strength in vain and for nothing. Yet what is due me is in the LORD&#x27;s hand, and my reward is with my God.&quot;</li><li>And now the LORD says-- he who formed me in the womb to be his servant to bring Jacob back to him and gather Israel to himself, for I am honored in the eyes of the LORD and my God has been my strength-</li><li>he says: &quot;It is too small a thing for you to be my servant to restore the tribes of Jacob and bring back those of Israel I have kept.
