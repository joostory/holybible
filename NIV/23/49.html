They will bow down before you with their faces to the ground; they will lick the dust at your feet. Then you will know that I am the LORD; those who hope in me will not be disappointed.&quot;</li><li>Can plunder be taken from warriors, or captives rescued from the fierce ?</li><li>But this is what the LORD says: &quot;Yes, captives will be taken from warriors, and plunder retrieved from the fierce; I will contend with those who contend with you, and your children I will save.</li><li>I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh; they will be drunk on their own blood, as with wine.
