But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men.</li><li>&quot;You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden.</li><li>Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.</li><li>In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.</li><li>&quot;Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.</li><li>I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.</li><li>Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</li><li>For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.</li><li>&quot;You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, &#x27;Do not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.&#x27;</li><li>But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brotherwill be subject to judgment.
