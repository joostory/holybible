He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Then he said to his servants, &#x27;The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&#x27;Friend,&#x27; he asked, &#x27;how did you get in here without wedding clothes?&#x27; The man was speechless.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Then the king told the attendants, &#x27;Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;For many are invited, but few are chosen.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. &quot;Teacher,&quot; they said, &quot;we know you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren&#x27;t swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, &quot;You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Show me the coin used for paying the tax.&quot; They brought him a denarius,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and he asked them, &quot;Whose portrait is this?

So they left him and went away.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Teacher,&quot; they said, &quot;Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and have children for him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now there were seven brothers among us.

He is not the God of the dead but of the living.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus replied: &quot; &#x27;Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">This is the first and greatest commandment.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And the second is like it: &#x27;Love your neighbor as yourself.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?&quot; &quot;The son of David,&quot; they replied.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He said to them, &quot;How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him &#x27;Lord&#x27;? For he says,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot; &#x27;The Lord said to my Lord: &quot;Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your
