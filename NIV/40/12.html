Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He answered, &quot;Haven&#x27;t you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread--which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Or haven&#x27;t you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple desecrate the day and yet are innocent?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I tell you that one greater than the temple is here.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If you had known what these words mean, &#x27;I desire mercy, not sacrifice,&#x27; you would not have condemned the innocent.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and a man with a shriveled hand was there.

Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he said to the man, &quot;Stretch out your hand.&quot; So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place.

For out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But I tell you that men will have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, &quot;Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He answered, &quot;A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a miraculous sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon&#x27;s wisdom, and now one greater than Solomon is here.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;When an evil spirit comes out of a man, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then it says, &#x27;I will return to the house I left.&#x27; When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean and put in order.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that man is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and
