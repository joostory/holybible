Looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, they asked him, &quot;Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?&quot;</li><li>He said to them, &quot;If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?</li><li>How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.&quot;</li><li>Then he said to the man, &quot;Stretch out your hand.&quot; So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other.</li><li>But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.</li><li>Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick,</li><li>warning them not to tell who he was.</li><li>This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:</li><li>&quot;Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.</li><li>He will not quarrel or cry out; no one will hear his voice in the streets.</li><li>A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, till he leads justice to victory.</li><li>In his name the nations will put their hope.&quot;</li><li>Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see.</li><li>All the people were astonished and said, &quot;Could this be the Son of David?&quot;</li><li>But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, &quot;It is only by Beelzebub, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.&quot;</li><li>Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, &quot;Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.</li><li>If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?</li><li>And if I drive out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your people drive them out?
