Looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, they asked him, &quot;Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?&quot;</li><li>He said to them, &quot;If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?</li><li>How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.&quot;</li><li>Then he said to the man, &quot;Stretch out your hand.&quot; So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other.</li><li>But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.</li><li>Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick,</li><li>warning them not to tell who he was.</li><li>This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:</li><li>&quot;Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.</li><li>He will not quarrel or cry out; no one will hear his voice in the streets.</li><li>A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, till he leads justice to victory.</li><li>In his name the nations will put their hope.&quot;</li><li>Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see.</li><li>All the people were astonished and said, &quot;Could this be the Son of David?&quot;</li><li>But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, &quot;It is only by Beelzebub, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.&quot;</li><li>Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, &quot;Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.</li><li>If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?</li><li>And if I drive out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.</li><li>But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</li><li>&quot;Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man&#x27;s house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can rob his house.</li><li>&quot;He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.</li><li>And so I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.</li><li>Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.</li><li>&quot;Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit.</li><li>You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good?
