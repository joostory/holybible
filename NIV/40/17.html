was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Peter said to Jesus, &quot;Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters--one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, &quot;This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.

I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, &#x27;Move from here to there&#x27; and it will move.
