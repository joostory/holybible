But they shouted all the louder, &quot;Crucify him!&quot;</li><li>When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. &quot;I am innocent of this man&#x27;s blood,&quot; he said. &quot;It is your responsibility!&quot;</li><li>All the people answered, &quot;Let his blood be on us and on our children!&quot;</li><li>Then he released Barabbas to them.

Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead.
