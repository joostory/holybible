morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the decision to put Jesus to death.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;I have sinned,&quot; he said, &quot;for I have betrayed innocent blood.&quot; &quot;What is that to us?&quot; they replied. &quot;That&#x27;s your responsibility.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The chief priests picked up the coins and said, &quot;It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So they decided to use the money to buy the potter&#x27;s field as a burial place for foreigners.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: &quot;They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and they used them to buy the potter&#x27;s field, as the Lord commanded me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, &quot;Are you the king of the Jews?&quot; &quot;Yes, it is as you say,&quot; Jesus replied.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Pilate asked him, &quot;Don&#x27;t you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge--to the great amazement of the governor.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now it was the governor&#x27;s custom at the Feast to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, &quot;Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">While Pilate was sitting on the judge&#x27;s seat, his wife sent him this message: &quot;Don&#x27;t have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Which of the two do you want me to release to you?&quot; asked the governor. &quot;Barabbas,&quot; they answered.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?&quot; Pilate asked. They all answered, &quot;Crucify him!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Why? What crime has he committed?&quot; asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, &quot;Crucify him!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. &quot;I am innocent of this man&#x27;s blood,&quot; he said. &quot;It is your responsibility!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">All the people answered, &quot;Let his blood be on us and on our children!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the governor&#x27;s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand and knelt in front of him and mocked him. &quot;Hail, king of the Jews!&quot; they said.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They came to a place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull).</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And sitting down, they kept watch over him there.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Above his head they placed the written charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and saying, &quot;You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;He saved others,&quot; they said, &quot;but he can&#x27;t save himself! He&#x27;s the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, &#x27;I am the Son of God.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, &quot;Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?&quot;--which means, &quot;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When some of those standing there heard this, they said, &quot;He&#x27;s calling Elijah.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The rest said, &quot;Now leave him alone. Let&#x27;s see if Elijah comes to save him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They came out of the tombs, and after Jesus&#x27; resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, &quot;Surely he was the Son of God!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee&#x27;s sons.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus&#x27; body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Sir,&quot; they said, &quot;we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, &#x27;After three days I will rise again.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Take a guard,&quot; Pilate answered. &quot;Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4 text-base gap-y-2 w-full"><li
