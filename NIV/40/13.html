Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he told them many things in parables, saying: &quot;A farmer went out to sow his seed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop--a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He who has ears, let him hear.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The disciples came to him and asked, &quot;Why do you speak to the people in parables?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He replied, &quot;The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">This is why I speak to them in parables: &quot;Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: &quot; &#x27;You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For this people&#x27;s heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Listen then to what the parable of the sower means:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But since he has no root, he lasts only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it. He produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus told them another parable: &quot;The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;The owner&#x27;s servants came to him and said, &#x27;Sir, didn&#x27;t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot; &#x27;An enemy did this,&#x27; he replied. &quot;The servants asked him, &#x27;Do you want us to go and pull them up?&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot; &#x27;No,&#x27; he answered, &#x27;because while you are pulling the weeds, you may root up the wheat with them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He told them another parable: &quot;The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Though it is the smallest of all your seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He told them still another parable: &quot;The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: &quot;I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, &quot;Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He answered, &quot;The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Have you understood all these things?&quot; Jesus asked. &quot;Yes,&quot; they replied.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He said to them, &quot;Therefore every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. &quot;Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?&quot; they asked.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Isn&#x27;t this the carpenter&#x27;s son? Isn&#x27;t his mother&#x27;s name Mary, and aren&#x27;t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Aren&#x27;t all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, &quot;Only in his hometown and in his own house is a prophet without honor.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200
