When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">But the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it.

At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">He told them another parable: &quot;The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Though it is the smallest of all your seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">He told them still another parable: &quot;The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: &quot;I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, &quot;Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">He answered, &quot;The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">and the enemy who sows them is the devil.

He who has ears, let him hear.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;Have you understood all these things?&quot; Jesus asked. &quot;Yes,&quot; they replied.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">He said to them, &quot;Therefore every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. &quot;Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?&quot; they asked.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_7ba92c">&quot;Isn&#x27;t this the carpenter&#x27;s son?
