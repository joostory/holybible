__className_420faa">&quot;About the third hour he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">He told them, &#x27;You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">So they went. &quot;He went out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did the same thing.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">About the eleventh hour he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, &#x27;Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot; &#x27;Because no one has hired us,&#x27; they answered. &quot;He said to them, &#x27;You also go and work in my vineyard.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, &#x27;Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;The workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&#x27;These men who were hired last worked only one hour,&#x27; they said, &#x27;and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;But he answered one of them, &#x27;Friend, I am not being unfair to you. Didn&#x27;t you agree to work for a denarius?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Take your pay and go.

They will condemn him to death</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">and will turn him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. On the third day he will be raised to life!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then the mother of Zebedee&#x27;s sons came to Jesus with her sons and, kneeling down, asked a favor of him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;What is it you want?&quot; he asked. She said, &quot;Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;You don&#x27;t know what you are asking,&quot; Jesus said to them. &quot;Can you drink the cup I am going to drink?&quot; &quot;We can,&quot; they answered.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Jesus said to them, &quot;You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Jesus called them together and said, &quot;You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">and whoever wants to be first must be your slave--</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was going by, they shouted, &quot;Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all the louder, &quot;Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Jesus stopped and called them. &quot;What do you want me to do for you?&quot; he asked.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">&quot;Lord,&quot; they answered, &quot;we want our sight.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes.
