finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, &quot;Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Haven&#x27;t you read,&quot; he replied, &quot;that at the beginning the Creator &#x27;made them male and female,&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and said, &#x27;For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh&#x27;?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Why then,&quot; they asked, &quot;did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus replied, &quot;Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The disciples said to him, &quot;If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus replied, &quot;Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For some are eunuchs because they were born that way; others were made that way by men; and others have renounced marriagebecause of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then little children were brought to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked those who brought them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus said, &quot;Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he had placed his hands on them, he went on from there.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now a man came up to Jesus and asked, &quot;Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Why do you ask me about what is good?&quot; Jesus replied. &quot;There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, obey the commandments.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Which ones?&quot; the man inquired. Jesus replied, &quot; &#x27;Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">honor your father and mother,&#x27; and &#x27;love your neighbor as yourself.&#x27;&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;All these I have kept,&quot; the young man said. &quot;What do I still lack?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus answered, &quot;If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Jesus said to his disciples, &quot;I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, &quot;Who then can be saved?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus looked at them and said, &quot;With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Peter answered him, &quot;We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus said to them, &quot;I tell you the truth, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.</li></ol></div></div><div
