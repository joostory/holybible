Jesus said to them, &quot;I tell you the truth, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you.</li><li>For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.</li><li>&quot;Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard.
