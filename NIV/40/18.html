the disciples came to Jesus and asked, &quot;Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He called a little child and had him stand among them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And he said: &quot;I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;And whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to sin! Such things must come, but woe to the man through whom they come!</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;See that you do not look down on one of these little ones.

Up to seven times?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus answered, &quot;I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;The servant fell on his knees before him. &#x27;Be patient with me,&#x27; he begged, &#x27;and I will pay back everything.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The servant&#x27;s master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. He grabbed him and began to choke him. &#x27;Pay back what you owe me!&#x27; he demanded.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, &#x27;Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the other servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed and went and told their master everything that had happened.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Then the master called the servant in. &#x27;You wicked servant,&#x27; he said, &#x27;I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Shouldn&#x27;t you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In anger his master turned him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart.&quot;</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60
