the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">It is written in Isaiah the prophet: &quot;I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way&quot;--</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;a voice of one calling in the desert, &#x27;Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And so John came, baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">John wore clothing made of camel&#x27;s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And this was his message: &quot;After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And a voice came from heaven: &quot;You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;The time has come,&quot; he said. &quot;The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Come, follow me,&quot; Jesus said, &quot;and I will make you fishers of men.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At once they left their nets and followed him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Be quiet!&quot; said Jesus sternly. &quot;Come out of him!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, &quot;What is this? A new teaching--and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Simon&#x27;s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The whole town gathered at the door,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Simon and his companions went to look for him,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and when they found him, they exclaimed: &quot;Everyone is looking for you!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus replied, &quot;Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, &quot;If you are willing, you can make me clean.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. &quot;I am willing,&quot; he said. &quot;Be clean!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;See that you don&#x27;t tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul
