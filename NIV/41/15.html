See how many things they are accusing you of.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now it was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?&quot; asked Pilate,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?&quot; Pilate asked them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Crucify him!&quot; they shouted.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Why? What crime has he committed?&quot; asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, &quot;Crucify him!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And they began to call out to him, &quot;Hail, king of the Jews!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull).</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">It was the third hour when they crucified him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The written notice of the charge against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They crucified two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677"></li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, &quot;So!

Let&#x27;s see if Elijah comes to take him down,&quot; he said.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and saw how he died, he said, &quot;Surely this man was the Son of God!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus&#x27; body.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was
