speak to them in parables: &quot;A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But they seized him, beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He sent still another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat, others they killed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;He had one left to send, a son, whom he loved. He sent him last of all, saying, &#x27;They will respect my son.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;But the tenants said to one another, &#x27;This is the heir. Come, let&#x27;s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So they took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Haven&#x27;t you read this scripture: &quot; &#x27;The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes&#x27;?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then they looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd; so they left him and went away.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They came to him and said, &quot;Teacher, we know you are a man of integrity. You aren&#x27;t swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Should we pay or shouldn&#x27;t we?&quot; But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. &quot;Why are you trying to trap me?&quot; he asked. &quot;Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They brought the coin, and he asked them, &quot;Whose portrait is this?

It was the same with the third.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In fact, none of the seven left any children.

You are badly mistaken!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, &quot;Of all the commandments, which is the most important?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;The most important one,&quot; answered Jesus, &quot;is this: &#x27;Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.&#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The second is this: &#x27;Love your neighbor as yourself.&#x27;There is no commandment greater than these.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Well said, teacher,&quot; the man replied. &quot;You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, &quot;You are not far from the kingdom of God.&quot; And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, &quot;How is it that the teachers of the law say that the Christ is the son of David?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: &quot; &#x27;The Lord said to my Lord: &quot;Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.&quot; &#x27;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">David himself calls him &#x27;Lord.&#x27; How then can he be his son?&quot; The large crowd listened to him with delight.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As he taught, Jesus said, &quot;Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted in the marketplaces,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They devour widows&#x27; houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins,worth only a fraction of a penny.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, &quot;I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in
