another large crowd gathered.

When he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people, and they did so.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They had a few small fish as well; he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The people ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">About four thousand men were present. And having sent them away,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Pharisees came and began to question Jesus. To test him, they asked him for a sign from heaven.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He sighed deeply and said, &quot;Why does this generation ask for a miraculous sign? I tell you the truth, no sign will be given to it.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he left them, got back into the boat and crossed to the other side.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Be careful,&quot; Jesus warned them. &quot;Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They discussed this with one another and said, &quot;It is because we have no bread.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: &quot;Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don&#x27;t you remember?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?&quot; &quot;Twelve,&quot; they replied.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?&quot; They answered, &quot;Seven.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He said to them, &quot;Do you still not understand?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man&#x27;s eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, &quot;Do you see anything?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He looked up and said, &quot;I see people; they look like trees walking around.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Once more Jesus put his hands on the man&#x27;s eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus sent him home, saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t go into the village.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, &quot;Who do people say I am?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They replied, &quot;Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;But what about you?&quot; he asked. &quot;Who do you say I am?&quot; Peter answered, &quot;You are the Christ.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. &quot;Get behind me, Satan!&quot; he said. &quot;You do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: &quot;If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his Father&#x27;s glory with the holy angels.&quot;</li></ol></div><button class="absolute btn btn-soft btn-circle right-5 bottom-5 hidden lg:flex"><svg
