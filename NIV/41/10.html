But Jesus said again, &quot;Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!</li><li>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&quot;</li><li>The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, &quot;Who then can be saved?&quot;</li><li>Jesus looked at them and said, &quot;With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God.&quot;</li><li>Peter said to him, &quot;We have left everything to follow you!&quot;</li><li>&quot;I tell you the truth,&quot; Jesus replied, &quot;no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel</li><li>will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields--and with them, persecutions) and in the age to come, eternal life.</li><li>But many who are first will be last, and the last first.&quot;</li><li>They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid.

Three days later he will rise.&quot;</li><li>Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. &quot;Teacher,&quot; they said, &quot;we want you to do for us whatever we ask.&quot;</li><li>&quot;What do you want me to do for you?&quot; he asked.</li><li>They replied, &quot;Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.&quot;</li><li>&quot;You don&#x27;t know what you are asking,&quot; Jesus said. &quot;Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?&quot;</li><li>&quot;We can,&quot; they answered. Jesus said to them, &quot;You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with,</li><li>but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant.

As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (that is, the Son of Timaeus), was sitting by the roadside begging.</li><li>When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, &quot;Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!&quot;</li><li>Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, &quot;Son of David, have mercy on me!&quot;</li><li>Jesus stopped and said, &quot;Call him.&quot; So they called to the blind man, &quot;Cheer up!
