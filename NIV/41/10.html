Three days later he will rise.&quot;</li><li>Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. &quot;Teacher,&quot; they said, &quot;we want you to do for us whatever we ask.&quot;</li><li>&quot;What do you want me to do for you?&quot; he asked.</li><li>They replied, &quot;Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.&quot;</li><li>&quot;You don&#x27;t know what you are asking,&quot; Jesus said. &quot;Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?&quot;</li><li>&quot;We can,&quot; they answered. Jesus said to them, &quot;You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with,</li><li>but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant.
