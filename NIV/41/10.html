These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus called them together and said, &quot;You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (that is, the Son of Timaeus), was sitting by the roadside begging.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, &quot;Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, &quot;Son of David, have mercy on me!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus stopped and said, &quot;Call him.&quot; So they called to the blind man, &quot;Cheer up! On your feet! He&#x27;s calling you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;What do you want me to do for you?&quot; Jesus asked him. The blind man said, &quot;Rabbi, I want to see.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Go,&quot; said Jesus, &quot;your faith has healed you.&quot;
