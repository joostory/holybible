not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Some men came, bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging through it, lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the

He&#x27;s blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, &quot;Why are you thinking these things?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, &#x27;Your sins are forgiven,&#x27; or to say, &#x27;Get up, take your mat and walk&#x27;?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins . . . .&quot; He said to the paralytic,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all.

A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector&#x27;s booth. &quot;Follow me,&quot; Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">While Jesus was having dinner at Levi&#x27;s house, many tax collectors and &quot;sinners&quot; were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the &quot;sinners&quot; and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: &quot;Why does he eat with tax collectors and &#x27;sinners&#x27;?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">On hearing this, Jesus said to them, &quot;It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now John&#x27;s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting.

They cannot, so long as they have him with them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, he pours new wine into new wineskins.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The Pharisees said to him, &quot;Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He answered, &quot;Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat.
