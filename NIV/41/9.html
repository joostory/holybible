How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.&quot;</li><li>So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion.

Taking him in his arms, he said to them,</li><li>&quot;Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Teacher,&quot; said John, &quot;we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Do not stop him,&quot; Jesus said. &quot;No one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me,</li><li>for whoever is not against us is for us.</li><li>I tell you the truth, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to Christ will certainly not lose his reward.</li><li>&quot;And if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck.</li><li>If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off.
