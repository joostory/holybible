Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village.</li><li>Calling the Twelve to him, he sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits.</li><li>These were his instructions: &quot;Take nothing for the journey except a staff--no bread, no bag, no money in your belts.</li><li>Wear sandals but not an extra tunic.</li><li>Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town.</li><li>And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave, as a testimony against them.&quot;</li><li>They went out and preached that people should repent.</li><li>They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.</li><li>King Herod heard about this, for Jesus&#x27; name had become well known. Some were saying, &quot;John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.&quot;</li><li>Others said, &quot;He is Elijah.&quot; And still others claimed, &quot;He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago.&quot;</li><li>But when Herod heard this, he said, &quot;John, the man I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!&quot;</li><li>For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip&#x27;s wife, whom he had married.</li><li>For John had been saying to Herod, &quot;It is not lawful for you to have your brother&#x27;s wife.&quot;</li><li>So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him.

So he began teaching them many things.</li><li>By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. &quot;This is a remote place,&quot; they said, &quot;and it&#x27;s already very late.</li><li>Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.&quot;</li><li>But he answered, &quot;You give them something to eat.&quot; They said to him, &quot;That would take eight months of a man&#x27;s wages! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?&quot;</li><li>&quot;How many loaves do you have?&quot; he asked. &quot;Go and see.&quot; When they found out, they said, &quot;Five--and two fish.&quot;</li><li>Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.</li><li>So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.</li><li>Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to set before the people.

About the fourth watch of the night he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them,</li><li>but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out,</li><li>because they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke to them and said, &quot;Take courage! It is I.
