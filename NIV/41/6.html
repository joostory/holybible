him, that he even does miracles!</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Isn&#x27;t this the carpenter?

Aren&#x27;t his sisters here with us?&quot; And they took offense at him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Jesus said to them, &quot;Only in his hometown, among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honor.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And he was amazed at their lack of faith. Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Calling the Twelve to him, he sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">These were his instructions: &quot;Take nothing for the journey except a staff--no bread, no bag, no money in your belts.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Wear sandals but not an extra tunic.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave, as a testimony against them.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">They went out and preached that people should repent.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">King Herod heard about this, for Jesus&#x27; name had become well known. Some were saying, &quot;John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Others said, &quot;He is Elijah.&quot; And still others claimed, &quot;He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But when Herod heard this, he said, &quot;John, the man I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip&#x27;s wife, whom he had married.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">For John had been saying to Herod, &quot;It is not lawful for you to have your brother&#x27;s wife.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled; yet he liked to listen to him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, &quot;Ask me for anything you want, and I&#x27;ll give it to you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And he promised her with an oath, &quot;Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">She went out and said to her mother, &quot;What shall I ask for?&quot; &quot;The head of John the Baptist,&quot; she answered.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: &quot;I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John&#x27;s head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">On hearing of this, John&#x27;s disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, &quot;Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. &quot;This is a remote place,&quot; they said, &quot;and it&#x27;s already very late.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But he answered, &quot;You give them something to eat.&quot; They said to him, &quot;That would take eight months of a man&#x27;s wages! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;How many loaves do you have?&quot; he asked. &quot;Go and see.&quot; When they found out, they said, &quot;Five--and two fish.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">They all ate and were satisfied,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">because they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke to them and said, &quot;Take courage! It is I. Don&#x27;t be afraid.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And wherever he went--into villages, towns or countryside--they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him were healed.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4 text-base gap-y-2"><li class="__className_872c54"><a href="/NIV"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-5 w-5"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.75 19.5 8.25 12l7.5-7.5"></path></svg></a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/1">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/2">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->2</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/3">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->3</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/4">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->4</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/5">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->5</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="active" href="/NIV/41/6">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->6</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/7">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->7</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/8">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->8</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/9">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->9</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/10">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->10</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/11">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->11</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/12">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->12</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/13">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->13</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/14">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->14</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/15">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->15</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/16">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->16</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"version":{"name":"NIV","vcode":"NIV"},"bible":{"bcode":41,"chapterCount":16,"name":"Mark","type":"new","vcode":"NIV"},"chapter":"6","verses":[{"bcode":41,"cnum":6,"content":"Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":1},{"bcode":41,"cnum":6,"content":"When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. \"Where did this man get these things?\" they asked. \"What's this wisdom that has been given him, that he even does miracles!","vcode":"NIV","vnum":2},{"bcode":41,"cnum":6,"content":"Isn't this the carpenter?
