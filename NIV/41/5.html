the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an evil spirit came from the tombs to meet him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him any more, not even with a chain.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He shouted at the top of his voice, &quot;What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you won&#x27;t torture me!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For Jesus had said to him, &quot;Come out of this man, you evil spirit!&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Jesus asked him, &quot;What is your name?&quot; &quot;My name is Legion,&quot; he replied, &quot;for we are many.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The demons begged Jesus, &quot;Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He gave them permission, and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man--and told about the pigs as well.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jesus did not let him, but said, &quot;Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolishow much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and pleaded earnestly with him, &quot;My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Jesus went with him. A large crowd followed and pressed around him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">because she thought, &quot;If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, &quot;Who touched my clothes?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;You see the people crowding against you,&quot; his disciples answered, &quot;and yet you can ask, &#x27;Who touched me?&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He said to her, &quot;Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. &quot;Your daughter is dead,&quot; they said. &quot;Why bother the teacher any more?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the synagogue ruler, &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid; just believe.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When they came to the home of the synagogue ruler, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He went in and said to them, &quot;Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But they laughed at him. After he put them all out, he took the child&#x27;s father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He took her by the hand and said to her, &quot;Talitha koum!&quot; (which means, &quot;Little girl, I say to you, get up!&quot; ).</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Immediately the girl stood up and walked around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4 text-base
