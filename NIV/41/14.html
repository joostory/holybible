So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus&#x27; disciples asked him, &quot;Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, &quot;Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Say to the owner of the house he enters, &#x27;The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?&#x27;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready.

Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. &quot;Simon,&quot; he said to Peter, &quot;are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Once more he went away and prayed the same thing.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Returning the third time, he said to them, &quot;Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: &quot;The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, &quot;Rabbi!&quot; and kissed him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The men seized Jesus and arrested him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;Am I leading a rebellion,&quot; said Jesus, &quot;that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then everyone deserted him and fled.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders and teachers of the law came together.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him:</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;We heard him say, &#x27;I will destroy this man-made temple and in three days will build another, not made by man.&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Yet even then their testimony did not agree.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, &quot;Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, &quot;Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;I am,&quot; said Jesus. &quot;And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The high priest tore his clothes. &quot;Why do we need any more witnesses?&quot; he asked.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?&quot; They all condemned him as worthy of death.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, &quot;Prophesy!&quot; And the guards took him and beat him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. &quot;You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus,&quot; she said.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">But he denied it. &quot;I don&#x27;t know or understand what you&#x27;re talking about,&quot; he said, and went out into the entryway.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, &quot;This fellow is one of them.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, &quot;Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">He began to call down curses on himself, and he swore to them, &quot;I don&#x27;t know this man you&#x27;re talking about.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: &quot;Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times.&quot; And he broke down and wept.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4"><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a href="/NIV"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" class="h-5 w-5"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.75 19.5L8.25 12l7.5-7.5"></path></svg></a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/1">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/2">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->2</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/3">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->3</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/4">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->4</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/5">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->5</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/6">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->6</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/7">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->7</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/8">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->8</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/9">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->9</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/10">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->10</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/11">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->11</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/12">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->12</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/13">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->13</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="active" href="/NIV/41/14">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->14</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/15">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->15</a></li><li class="__className_7b3cf7"><a class="" href="/NIV/41/16">Mark<!-- --> <!-- -->16</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"version":{"name":"NIV","vcode":"NIV"},"bible":{"bcode":41,"chapterCount":16,"name":"Mark","type":"new","vcode":"NIV"},"chapter":"14","verses":[{"bcode":41,"cnum":14,"content":"Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were only two days away, and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some sly way to arrest Jesus and kill him.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":1},{"bcode":41,"cnum":14,"content":"\"But not during the Feast,\" they said, \"or the people may riot.\"","vcode":"NIV","vnum":2},{"bcode":41,"cnum":14,"content":"While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard.
