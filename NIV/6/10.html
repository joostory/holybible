Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Ai and totally destroyed it, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and that the people of Gibeon had made a treaty of peace with Israel and were living near them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">He and his people were very much alarmed at this, because Gibeon was an important city, like one of the royal cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its men were good fighters.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem appealed to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish and Debir king of Eglon.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;Come up and help me attack Gibeon,&quot; he said, &quot;because it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then the five kings of the Amorites--the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon--joined forces. They moved up with all their troops and took up positions against Gibeon and attacked it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The Gibeonites then sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: &quot;Do not abandon your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, because all the Amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with his entire army, including all the best fighting men.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The LORD said to Joshua, &quot;Do not be afraid of them; I have given them into your hand. Not one of them will be able to withstand you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">After an all-night march from Gilgal, Joshua took them by surprise.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The LORD threw them into confusion before Israel, who defeated them in a great victory at Gibeon. Israel pursued them along the road going up to Beth Horon and cut them down all the way to Azekah and Makkedah.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">As they fled before Israel on the road down from Beth Horon to Azekah, the LORD hurled large hailstones down on them from the sky, and more of them died from the hailstones than were killed by the swords of the Israelites.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">On the day the LORD gave the Amorites over to Israel, Joshua said to the LORD in the presence of Israel: &quot;O sun, stand still over Gibeon, O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the nation avenged itself on its enemies, as it is written in the Book of Jashar. The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">There has never been a day like it before or since, a day when the LORD listened to a man.

Be strong and courageous. This is what the LORD will do to all the enemies you are going to fight.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then Joshua struck and killed the kings and hung them on five trees, and they were left hanging on the trees until evening.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">At sunset Joshua gave the order and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had been hiding.

He put the city and its king to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it. He left no survivors. And he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Makkedah to Libnah and attacked it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The LORD also gave that city and its king into Israel&#x27;s hand. The city and everyone in it Joshua put to the sword. He left no survivors there. And he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Libnah to Lachish; he took up positions against it and attacked it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The LORD handed Lachish over to Israel, and Joshua took it on the second day. The city and everyone in it he put to the sword, just as he had done to Libnah.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Meanwhile, Horam king of Gezer had come up to help Lachish, but Joshua defeated him and his army--until no survivors were left.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Lachish to Eglon; they took up positions against it and attacked it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">They captured it that same day and put it to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it, just as they had done to Lachish.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron and attacked it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">They took the city and put it to the sword, together with its king, its villages and everyone in it. They left no survivors. Just as at Eglon, they totally destroyed it and everyone in it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned around and attacked Debir.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">They took the city, its king and its villages, and put them to the sword. Everyone in it they totally destroyed. They left no survivors. They did to Debir and its king as they had done to Libnah and its king and to Hebron.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">So Joshua subdued the whole region, including the hill country, the Negev, the western foothills and the mountain slopes, together with all their kings.
