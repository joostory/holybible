A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace.</li><li>How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?</li><li>Nevertheless, each one should retain the place in life that the Lord assigned to him and to which God has called him.

Don&#x27;t let it trouble you--although if you can gain your freedom, do so.</li><li>For he who was a slave when he was called by the Lord is the Lord&#x27;s freedman; similarly, he who was a free man when he was called is Christ&#x27;s slave.</li><li>You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men.</li><li>Brothers, each man, as responsible to God, should remain in the situation God called him to.</li><li>Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord&#x27;s mercy is trustworthy.</li><li>Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for you to remain as you are.</li><li>Are you married?

An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord&#x27;s affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.</li><li>I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord.</li><li>If anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married.</li><li>But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right thing.</li><li>So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does even better.</li><li>A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord.</li><li>In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4"><li><a href="/NIV">&lt;</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/46/1">1 Corinthians<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/46/2">1 Corinthians<!-- --> <!-- -->2</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/46/3">1 Corinthians<!-- --> <!-- -->3</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/46/4">1 Corinthians<!-- --> <!-- -->4</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/46/5">1 Corinthians<!-- --> <!-- -->5</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/46/6">1 Corinthians<!-- --> <!-- -->6</a></li><li><a class="active" href="/NIV/46/7">1 Corinthians<!-- --> <!-- -->7</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/46/8">1 Corinthians<!-- --> <!-- -->8</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/46/9">1 Corinthians<!-- --> <!-- -->9</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/46/10">1 Corinthians<!-- --> <!-- -->10</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/46/11">1 Corinthians<!-- --> <!-- -->11</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/46/12">1 Corinthians<!-- --> <!-- -->12</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/46/13">1 Corinthians<!-- --> <!-- -->13</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/46/14">1 Corinthians<!-- --> <!-- -->14</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/46/15">1 Corinthians<!-- --> <!-- -->15</a></li><li><a class="" href="/NIV/46/16">1 Corinthians<!-- --> <!-- -->16</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"version":{"name":"NIV","vcode":"NIV"},"bible":{"bcode":46,"chapterCount":16,"name":"1 Corinthians","type":"new","vcode":"NIV"},"chapter":"7","verses":[{"bcode":46,"cnum":7,"content":"Now for the matters you wrote about: It is good for a man not to marry.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":1},{"bcode":46,"cnum":7,"content":"But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":2},{"bcode":46,"cnum":7,"content":"The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.","vcode":"NIV","vnum":3},{"bcode":46,"cnum":7,"content":"The wife's body does not belong to her alone but also to her husband.
