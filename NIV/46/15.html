brothers, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them--yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Whether, then, it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied more than all men.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But each in his own turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The last enemy to be destroyed is death.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For he &quot;has put everything under his feet.&quot; Now when it says that &quot;everything&quot; has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now if there is no resurrection, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And as for us, why do we endanger ourselves every hour?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I die every day--I mean that, brothers--just as surely as I glory over you in Christ Jesus our Lord.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for merely human reasons, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, &quot;Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Do not be misled: &quot;Bad company corrupts good character.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God--I say this to your shame.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But someone may ask, &quot;How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">All flesh is not the same: Men have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So it is written: &quot;The first man Adam became a living being&quot;; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the man from heaven, so also are those who are of heaven.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so shall we bear the likeness of the man from heaven.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I declare to you, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed--</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: &quot;Death has been swallowed up in victory.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0
