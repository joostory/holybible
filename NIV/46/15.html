If the dead are not raised, &quot;Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Do not be misled: &quot;Bad company corrupts good character.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God--I say this to your shame.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But someone may ask, &quot;How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">All flesh is not the same: Men have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">So it is written: &quot;The first man Adam became a living being&quot;; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the man from heaven, so also are those who are of heaven.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so shall we bear the likeness of the man from heaven.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">I declare to you, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed--</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: &quot;Death has been swallowed up in victory.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">&quot;Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm. Let nothing move you.
