But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised.</li><li>For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either.</li><li>And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.</li><li>Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.</li><li>If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied more than all men.</li><li>But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.</li><li>For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.</li><li>For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.</li><li>But each in his own turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him.</li><li>Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power.</li><li>For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.</li><li>The last enemy to be destroyed is death.</li><li>For he &quot;has put everything under his feet.&quot; Now when it says that &quot;everything&quot; has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ.</li><li>When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.</li><li>Now if there is no resurrection, what will those do who are baptized for the dead?

What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.</li><li>When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else.</li><li>But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body.</li><li>All flesh is not the same: Men have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another.</li><li>There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another.</li><li>The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor.</li><li>So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable;</li><li>it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;</li><li>it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.</li><li>So it is written: &quot;The first man Adam became a living being&quot;; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit.</li><li>The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual.</li><li>The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven.</li><li>As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the man from heaven, so also are those who are of heaven.</li><li>And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so shall we bear the likeness of the man from heaven.</li><li>I declare to you, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.</li><li>Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed--</li><li>in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.</li><li>For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality.</li><li>When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: &quot;Death has been swallowed up in victory.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?&quot;</li><li>The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</li><li>But thanks be to God!
