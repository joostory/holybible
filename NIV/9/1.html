certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the LORD Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the LORD.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the LORD had closed her womb.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And because the LORD had closed her womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the LORD, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Elkanah her husband would say to her, &quot;Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don&#x27;t you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don&#x27;t I mean more to you than ten sons?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the LORD&#x27;s temple.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In bitterness of soul Hannah wept much and prayed to the LORD.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And she made a vow, saying, &quot;O LORD Almighty, if you will only look upon your servant&#x27;s misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the LORD for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As she kept on praying to the LORD, Eli observed her mouth.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and said to her, &quot;How long will you keep on getting drunk? Get rid of your wine.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Not so, my lord,&quot; Hannah replied, &quot;I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to the LORD.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Eli answered, &quot;Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">She said, &quot;May your servant find favor in your eyes.&quot; Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the LORD and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah lay with Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So in the course of time Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, saying, &quot;Because I asked the LORD for him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the man Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the LORD and to fulfill his vow,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, &quot;After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before the LORD, and he will live there always.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Do what seems best to you,&quot; Elkanah her husband told her. &quot;Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the LORD make good his word.&quot; So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When they had slaughtered the bull, they brought the boy to Eli,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and she said to him, &quot;As surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the LORD.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I prayed for this child, and the LORD has granted me what I asked of him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So now I give him to the LORD. For his whole life he will be given over to the LORD.&quot; And he worshiped the LORD there.</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60
