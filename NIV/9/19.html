But Jonathan was very fond of David</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and warned him, &quot;My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. Be on your guard tomorrow morning; go into hiding and stay there.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are. I&#x27;ll speak to him about you and will tell you what I find out.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, &quot;Let not the king do wrong to his servant David; he has not wronged you, and what he has done has benefited you greatly.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He took his life in his hands when he killed the Philistine. The LORD won a great victory for all Israel, and you saw it and were glad. Why then would you do wrong to an innocent man like David by killing him for no reason?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Saul listened to Jonathan and took this oath: &quot;As surely as the LORD lives, David will not be put to death.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Jonathan called David and told him the whole conversation. He brought him to Saul, and David was with Saul as before.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Once more war broke out, and David went out and fought the Philistines. He struck them with such force that they fled before him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But an evil spirit from the LORD came upon Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand. While David was playing the harp,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear, but David eluded him as Saul drove the spear into the wall. That night David made good his escape.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Saul sent men to David&#x27;s house to watch it and to kill him in the morning.

Why should I kill you?&#x27; &quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When David had fled and made his escape, he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him.

But when they saw a group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing there as their leader, the Spirit of God came upon Saul&#x27;s men and they also prophesied.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Saul was told about it, and he sent more men, and they prophesied too. Saul sent men a third time, and they also prophesied.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Finally, he himself left for Ramah and went to the great cistern at Secu. And he asked, &quot;Where are Samuel and David?&quot; &quot;Over in Naioth at Ramah,&quot; they said.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So Saul went to Naioth at Ramah. But the Spirit of God came even upon him, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He stripped off his robes and also prophesied in Samuel&#x27;s presence. He lay that way all that day and night.
