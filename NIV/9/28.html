Why have you set a trap for my life to bring about my death?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Saul swore to her by the LORD, &quot;As surely as the LORD lives, you will not be punished for this.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then the woman asked, &quot;Whom shall I bring up for you?&quot; &quot;Bring up Samuel,&quot; he said.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out at the top of her voice and said to Saul, &quot;Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">The king said to her, &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid.

Then Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Samuel said to Saul, &quot;Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?&quot; &quot;I am in great distress,&quot; Saul said. &quot;The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has turned away from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what to do.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Samuel said, &quot;Why do you consult me, now that the LORD has turned away from you and become your enemy?</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">The LORD has done what he predicted through me. The LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighbors--to David.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Because you did not obey the LORD or carry out his fierce wrath against the Amalekites, the LORD has done this to you today.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">The LORD will hand over both Israel and you to the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The LORD will also hand over the army of Israel to the Philistines.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, filled with fear because of Samuel&#x27;s words. His strength was gone, for he had eaten nothing all that day and night.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">When the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly shaken, she said, &quot;Look, your maidservant has obeyed you. I took my life in my hands and did what you told me to do.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Now please listen to your servant and let me give you some food so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">He refused and said, &quot;I will not eat.&quot; But his men joined the woman in urging him, and he listened to them. He got up from the ground and sat on the couch.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">The woman had a fattened calf at the house, which she butchered at once. She took some flour, kneaded it and baked bread without yeast.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_420faa">Then she set it before Saul and his men, and they ate.
