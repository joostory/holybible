Now the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They had attacked Ziklag and burned it,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and had taken captive the women and all who were in it, both young and old. They killed none of them, but carried them off as they went on their way.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When David and his men came to Ziklag, they found it destroyed by fire and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So David and his men wept aloud until they had no strength left to weep.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">David&#x27;s two wives had been captured--Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">David was greatly distressed because the men were talking of stoning him; each one was bitter in spirit because of his sons and daughters. But David found strength in the LORD his God.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, &quot;Bring me the ephod.&quot; Abiathar brought it to him,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and David inquired of the LORD, &quot;Shall I pursue this raiding party? Will I overtake them?&quot; &quot;Pursue them,&quot; he answered. &quot;You will certainly overtake them and succeed in the rescue.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">David and the six hundred men with him came to the Besor Ravine, where some stayed behind,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">for two hundred men were too exhausted to cross the ravine. But David and four hundred men continued the pursuit.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They found an Egyptian in a field and brought him to David. They gave him water to drink and food to eat-</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">part of a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of raisins. He ate and was revived, for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and three nights.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">David asked him, &quot;To whom do you belong, and where do you come from?&quot; He said, &quot;I am an Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me when I became ill three days ago.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">We raided the Negev of the Kerethites and the territory belonging to Judah and the Negev of Caleb.

David brought everything back.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He took all the flocks and herds, and his men drove them ahead of the other livestock, saying, &quot;This is David&#x27;s plunder.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow him and who were left behind at the Besor Ravine. They came out to meet David and the people with him. As David and his men approached, he greeted them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But all the evil men and troublemakers among David&#x27;s followers said, &quot;Because they did not go out with us, we will not share with them the plunder we recovered. However, each man may take his wife and children and go.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">David replied, &quot;No, my brothers, you must not do that with what the LORD has given us.

The share of the man who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle. All will share alike.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">David made this a statute and ordinance for Israel from that day to this.</li><li class="pl-3

you from the plunder of the LORD&#x27;s enemies.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">He sent it to those who were in Bethel, Ramoth Negev and
