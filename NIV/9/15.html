Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.&#x27; &quot;</li><li>So Saul summoned the men and mustered them at Telaim--two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men from Judah.</li><li>Saul went to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the ravine.</li><li>Then he said to the Kenites, &quot;Go away, leave the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you along with them; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt.&quot; So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.</li><li>Then Saul attacked the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, to the east of Egypt.</li><li>He took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and all his people he totally destroyed with the sword.</li><li>But Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves and lambs--everything that was good. These they were unwilling to destroy completely, but everything that was despised and weak they totally destroyed.</li><li>Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel:</li><li>&quot;I am grieved that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me and has not carried out my instructions.&quot; Samuel was troubled, and he cried out to the LORD all that night.</li><li>Early in the morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul, but he was told, &quot;Saul has gone to Carmel. There he has set up a monument in his own honor and has turned and gone on down to Gilgal.&quot;</li><li>When Samuel reached him, Saul said, &quot;The LORD bless you! I have carried out the LORD&#x27;s instructions.&quot;</li><li>But Samuel said, &quot;What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears? What is this lowing of cattle that I hear?&quot;</li><li>Saul answered, &quot;The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the LORD your God, but we totally destroyed the rest.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Stop!&quot; Samuel said to Saul. &quot;Let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night.&quot; &quot;Tell me,&quot; Saul replied.</li><li>Samuel said, &quot;Although you were once small in your own eyes, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel.</li><li>And he sent you on a mission, saying, &#x27;Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; make war on them until you have wiped them out.&#x27;</li><li>Why did you not obey the LORD ? Why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the LORD ?&quot;</li><li>&quot;But I did obey the LORD,&quot; Saul said. &quot;I went on the mission the LORD assigned me.

To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams.</li><li>For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has rejected you as king.&quot;</li><li>Then Saul said to Samuel, &quot;I have sinned. I violated the LORD&#x27;s command and your instructions. I was afraid of the people and so I gave in to them.</li><li>Now I beg you, forgive my sin and come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD.&quot;</li><li>But Samuel said to him, &quot;I will not go back with you. You have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you as king over Israel!&quot;</li><li>As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore.</li><li>Samuel said to him, &quot;The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors--to one better than you.</li><li>He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a man, that he should change his mind.&quot;</li><li>Saul replied, &quot;I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel; come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD your God.&quot;</li><li>So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD.</li><li>Then Samuel said, &quot;Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites.&quot; Agag came to him confidently, thinking, &quot;Surely the bitterness of death is past.&quot;</li><li>But Samuel said, &quot;As your sword has made women childless, so will your mother be childless among women.&quot; And Samuel put Agag to death before the LORD at Gilgal.</li><li>Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul.</li><li>Until the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again, though Samuel mourned for him.
