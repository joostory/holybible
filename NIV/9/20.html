Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, &quot;Why hasn&#x27;t the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Jonathan answered, &quot;David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He said, &#x27;Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there.

What has he done?&quot; Jonathan asked his father.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. Then Jonathan knew that his father intended to kill David.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger; on that second day of the month he did not eat, because he was grieved at his father&#x27;s shameful treatment of David.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David. He had a small boy with him,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">and he said to the boy, &quot;Run and find the arrows I shoot.&quot; As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When the boy came to the place where Jonathan&#x27;s arrow had fallen, Jonathan called out after him, &quot;Isn&#x27;t the arrow beyond you?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then he shouted, &quot;Hurry!
