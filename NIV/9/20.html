Look, my father doesn&#x27;t do anything, great or small, without confiding in me. Why would he hide this from me? It&#x27;s not so!&quot;</li><li>But David took an oath and said, &quot;Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said to himself, &#x27;Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.&#x27; Yet as surely as the LORD lives and as you live, there is only a step between me and death.&quot;</li><li>Jonathan said to David, &quot;Whatever you want me to do, I&#x27;ll do for you.&quot;</li><li>So David said, &quot;Look, tomorrow is the New Moon festival, and I am supposed to dine with the king; but let me go and hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow.</li><li>If your father misses me at all, tell him, &#x27;David earnestly asked my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because an annual sacrifice is being made there for his whole clan.&#x27;</li><li>If he says, &#x27;Very well,&#x27; then your servant is safe. But if he loses his temper, you can be sure that he is determined to harm me.</li><li>As for you, show kindness to your servant, for you have brought him into a covenant with you before the LORD.

Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, &quot;Why hasn&#x27;t the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?&quot;</li><li>Jonathan answered, &quot;David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem.</li><li>He said, &#x27;Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there. If I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away to see my brothers.&#x27; That is why he has not come to the king&#x27;s table.&quot;</li><li>Saul&#x27;s anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him, &quot;You son of a perverse and rebellious woman!

Now send and bring him to me, for he must die!&quot;</li><li>&quot;Why should he be put to death? What has he done?&quot; Jonathan asked his father.</li><li>But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. Then Jonathan knew that his father intended to kill David.</li><li>Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger; on that second day of the month he did not eat, because he was grieved at his father&#x27;s shameful treatment of David.</li><li>In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David. He had a small boy with him,</li><li>and he said to the boy, &quot;Run and find the arrows I shoot.&quot; As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</li><li>When the boy came to the place where Jonathan&#x27;s arrow had fallen, Jonathan called out after him, &quot;Isn&#x27;t the arrow beyond you?&quot;</li><li>Then he shouted, &quot;Hurry!
