Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, &quot;Why hasn&#x27;t the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Jonathan answered, &quot;David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">He said, &#x27;Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there.

What has he done?&quot; Jonathan asked his father.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. Then Jonathan knew that his father intended to kill David.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger; on that second day of the month he did not eat, because he was grieved at his father&#x27;s shameful treatment of David.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David. He had a small boy with him,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">and he said to the boy, &quot;Run and find the arrows I shoot.&quot; As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When the boy came to the place where Jonathan&#x27;s arrow had fallen, Jonathan called out after him, &quot;Isn&#x27;t the arrow beyond you?&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then he shouted, &quot;Hurry! Go quickly!

Then they kissed each other and wept together--but David wept the most.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Jonathan said to David, &quot;Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of the LORD, saying, &#x27;The LORD is witness between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants forever.&#x27; &quot; Then David left, and Jonathan went back to the town.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4 text-base gap-y-2 w-full"><li class="__className_872c54"><a href="/NIV"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-5 w-5"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.75 19.5 8.25 12l7.5-7.5"></path></svg></a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/1">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/2">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->2</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/3">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->3</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/4">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->4</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/5">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->5</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/6">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->6</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/7">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->7</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/8">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->8</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/9">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->9</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/10">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->10</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/11">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->11</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/12">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->12</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/13">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->13</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/14">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->14</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/15">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->15</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/16">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->16</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/17">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->17</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/18">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->18</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/19">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->19</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="menu-active" href="/NIV/9/20">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->20</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/21">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->21</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/22">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->22</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/23">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->23</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/24">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->24</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/25">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->25</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/26">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->26</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/27">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->27</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/28">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->28</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/29">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->29</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/30">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->30</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/31">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->31</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"version":{"name":"NIV","vcode":"NIV"},"bible":{"bcode":9,"chapterCount":31,"name":"1 Samuel","type":"old","vcode":"NIV"},"chapter":"20","verses":[{"bcode":9,"cnum":20,"content":"Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked, \"What have I done?
