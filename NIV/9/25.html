And when the LORD has brought my master success, remember your servant.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">David said to Abigail, &quot;Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has sent you today to meet me.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">May you be blessed for your good judgment and for keeping me from bloodshed this day and from avenging myself with my own hands.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Otherwise, as surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, who has kept me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, not one male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by daybreak.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought him and said, &quot;Go home in peace. I have heard your words and granted your request.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">When Abigail went to Nabal, he was in the house holding a banquet like that of a king. He was in high spirits and very drunk. So she told him nothing until daybreak.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">Then in the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him all these things, and his heart failed him and he became like a stone.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">About ten days later, the LORD struck Nabal and he died.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_4e4250">When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, &quot;Praise be to the LORD, who has upheld my cause against Nabal for treating me with contempt.
