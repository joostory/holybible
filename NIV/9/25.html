He is such a wicked man that no one can talk to him.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Abigail lost no time. She took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs of roasted grain, a hundred cakes of raisins and two hundred cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them on donkeys.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then she told her servants, &quot;Go on ahead; I&#x27;ll follow you.&quot; But she did not tell her husband Nabal.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">As she came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, there were David and his men descending toward her, and she met them.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">David had just said, &quot;It&#x27;s been useless--all my watching over this fellow&#x27;s property in the desert so that nothing of his was missing.

Let no wrongdoing be found in you as long as you live.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Even though someone is pursuing you to take your life, the life of my master will be bound securely in the bundle of the living by the LORD your God. But the lives of your enemies he will hurl away as from the pocket of a sling.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When the LORD has done for my master every good thing he promised concerning him and has appointed him leader over Israel,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">my master will not have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed or of having avenged himself. And when the LORD has brought my master success, remember your servant.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">David said to Abigail, &quot;Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has sent you today to meet me.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">May you be blessed for your good judgment and for keeping me from bloodshed this day and from avenging myself with my own hands.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Otherwise, as surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, who has kept me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, not one male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by daybreak.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought him and said, &quot;Go home in peace. I have heard your words and granted your request.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When Abigail went to Nabal, he was in the house holding a banquet like that of a king. He was in high spirits and very drunk. So she told him nothing until daybreak.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Then in the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him all these things, and his heart failed him and he became like a stone.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">About ten days later, the LORD struck Nabal and he died.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, &quot;Praise be to the LORD, who has upheld my cause against Nabal for treating me with contempt. He has kept his servant from doing wrong and has brought Nabal&#x27;s wrongdoing down on his own head.&quot; Then David sent word to Abigail, asking her to become his wife.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">His servants went to Carmel and said to Abigail, &quot;David has sent us to you to take you to become his wife.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">She bowed down with her face to the ground and said, &quot;Here is your maidservant, ready to serve you and wash the feet of my master&#x27;s servants.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">Abigail quickly got on a donkey and, attended by her five maids, went with David&#x27;s messengers and became his wife.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both were his wives.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5b4dad">But Saul had given his daughter Michal, David&#x27;s wife, to Paltiel son of Laish, who was from Gallim.</li></ol></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0 md:right-auto md:w-60 overflow-y-auto bg-base-200 bg-content"><ul class="menu p-4 text-base gap-y-2 w-full"><li class="__className_872c54"><a href="/NIV"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" data-slot="icon" class="h-5 w-5"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M15.75 19.5 8.25 12l7.5-7.5"></path></svg></a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/1">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->1</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/2">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->2</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/3">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->3</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/4">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->4</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/5">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->5</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/6">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->6</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/7">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->7</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/8">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->8</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/9">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->9</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/10">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->10</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/11">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->11</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/12">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->12</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/13">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->13</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/14">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->14</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/15">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->15</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/16">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->16</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/17">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->17</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/18">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->18</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/19">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->19</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/20">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->20</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/21">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->21</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/22">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->22</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/23">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->23</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/24">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->24</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="menu-active" href="/NIV/9/25">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->25</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/26">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->26</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/27">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->27</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/28">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->28</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/29">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->29</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/30">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->30</a></li><li class="__className_872c54"><a class="" href="/NIV/9/31">1 Samuel<!-- --> <!-- -->31</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"version":{"name":"NIV","vcode":"NIV"},"bible":{"bcode":9,"chapterCount":31,"name":"1 Samuel","type":"old","vcode":"NIV"},"chapter":"25","verses":[{"bcode":9,"cnum":25,"content":"Now Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned for him;
