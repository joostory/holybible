So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then the LORD said, &quot;If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first miraculous sign, they may believe the second.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground.
