When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the river bank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her slave girl to get it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. &quot;This is one of the Hebrew babies,&quot; she said.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Then his sister asked Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter, &quot;Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">&quot;Yes, go,&quot; she answered. And the girl went and got the baby&#x27;s mother.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter said to her, &quot;Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.&quot; So the woman took the baby and nursed him.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter and he became her son.
