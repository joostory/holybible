You are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The animals you choose must be year-old males without defect, and you may take them from the sheep or the goats.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month, when all the people of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">That same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire, along with bitter herbs, and bread made without yeast.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Do not eat the meat raw or cooked in water, but roast it over the fire--head, legs and inner parts.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Do not leave any of it till morning; if some is left till morning, you must burn it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is the LORD&#x27;s Passover.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn--both men and animals--and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the LORD.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;This is a day you are to commemorate; for the generations to come you shall celebrate it as a festival to the LORD -a lasting ordinance.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove the yeast from your houses, for whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">On the first day hold a sacred assembly, and another one on the seventh day. Do no work at all on these days, except to prepare food for everyone to eat--that is all you may do.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because it was on this very day that I brought your divisions out of Egypt. Celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">In the first month you are to eat bread made without yeast, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">For seven days no yeast is to be found in your houses. And whoever eats anything with yeast in it must be cut off from the community of Israel, whether he is an alien or native-born.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Eat nothing made with yeast. Wherever you live, you must eat unleavened bread.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, &quot;Go at once and select the animals for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe.

Leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, worship the LORD as you have requested.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Take your flocks and herds, as you have said, and go. And also bless me.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country. &quot;For otherwise,&quot; they said, &quot;we will all die!&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">So the people took their dough before the yeast was added, and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The LORD had made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the Egyptians.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Many other people went up with them, as well as large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">With the dough they had brought from Egypt, they baked cakes of unleavened bread. The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Now the length of time the Israelite people lived in Egypt was 430 years.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all the LORD&#x27;s divisions left Egypt.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Because the LORD kept vigil that night to bring them out of Egypt, on this night all the Israelites are to keep vigil to honor the LORD for the generations to come.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, &quot;These are the regulations for the Passover: &quot;No foreigner is to eat of it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">Any slave you have bought may eat of it after you have circumcised him,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">but a temporary resident and a hired worker may not eat of it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;It must be eaten inside one house; take none of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The whole community of Israel must celebrate it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">&quot;An alien living among you who wants to celebrate the LORD&#x27;s Passover must have all the males in his household circumcised; then he may take part like one born in the land. No uncircumcised male may eat of it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">The same law applies to the native-born and to the alien living among you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">All the Israelites did just what the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter">And on that very day the LORD
