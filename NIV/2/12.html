Leave my people, you and the Israelites!

There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Many other people went up with them, as well as large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">With the dough they had brought from Egypt, they baked cakes of unleavened bread. The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Now the length of time the Israelite people lived in Egypt was 430 years.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all the LORD&#x27;s divisions left Egypt.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Because the LORD kept vigil that night to bring them out of Egypt, on this night all the Israelites are to keep vigil to honor the LORD for the generations to come.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, &quot;These are the regulations for the Passover: &quot;No foreigner is to eat of it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">Any slave you have bought may eat of it after you have circumcised him,</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">but a temporary resident and a hired worker may not eat of it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">&quot;It must be eaten inside one house; take none of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">The whole community of Israel must celebrate it.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">&quot;An alien living among you who wants to celebrate the LORD&#x27;s Passover must have all the males in his household circumcised; then he may take part like one born in the land.

you.&quot;</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_5455f5">All the Israelites did just what the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.</li><li class="pl-2 mb-1
