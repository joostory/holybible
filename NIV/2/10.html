Let my people go, so that they may worship me.</li><li>If you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow.</li><li>They will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen.

Let the people go, so that they may worship the LORD their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?&quot;</li><li>Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. &quot;Go, worship the LORD your God,&quot; he said. &quot;But just who will be going?&quot;</li><li>Moses answered, &quot;We will go with our young and old, with our sons and daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival to the LORD.&quot;</li><li>Pharaoh said, &quot;The LORD be with you--if I let you go, along with your women and children! Clearly you are bent on evil.</li><li>No! Have only the men go; and worship the LORD, since that&#x27;s what you have been asking for.&quot; Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh&#x27;s presence.</li><li>And the LORD said to Moses, &quot;Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts will swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything left by the hail.&quot;</li><li>So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the LORD made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night.

Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again.</li><li>They covered all the ground until it was black.
