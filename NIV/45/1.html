of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God--</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">regarding his Son, who as to his human nature was a descendant of David,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and who through the Spirit of holiness was declared with power to be the Son of God by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Through him and for his name&#x27;s sake, we received grace and apostleship to call people from among all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And you also are among those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">God, whom I serve with my whole heart in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last by God&#x27;s will the way may be opened for me to come to you.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong--</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other&#x27;s faith.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are at Rome.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: &quot;The righteous will live by faith.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For since the creation of the world God&#x27;s invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is forever praised. Amen.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Although they know God&#x27;s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.</li></ol></div><button class="absolute btn btn-soft btn-circle right-5 bottom-5 hidden lg:flex"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24"
