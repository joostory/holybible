brothers--for I am speaking to men who know the law--that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So, my brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For when we were controlled by the sinful nature, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, so that we bore fruit for death.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, &quot;Do not covet.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from law, sin is dead.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Once I was alive apart from law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do--this I keep on doing.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">So I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For in my inner being I delight in God&#x27;s law;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Thanks be to God--through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God&#x27;s law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.</li></ol></div></div><div class="max-[768px]:hidden"><div class="absolute inset-0
