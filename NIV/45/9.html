in my heart.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, those of my own race,</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of Christ, who is God over all, forever praised! Amen.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">It is not as though God&#x27;s word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham&#x27;s children. On the contrary, &quot;It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">In other words, it is not the natural children who are God&#x27;s children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham&#x27;s offspring.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">For this was how the promise was stated: &quot;At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Not only that, but Rebekah&#x27;s children had one and the same father, our father Isaac.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad--in order that God&#x27;s purpose in election might stand:</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">not by works but by him who calls--she was told, &quot;The older will serve the younger.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Just as it is written: &quot;Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">What then shall we say?

That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">but Israel, who pursued a law of righteousness, has not attained it.</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the &quot;stumbling stone.&quot;</li><li class="pl-3 mb-2 leading-relaxed tracking-tighter __className_a5c677">As it is written: &quot;See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes men to
